          "reviews": "“With Spacecom 11bit studios created perfectly working game mechanics which prove that you do not need elaborate animations to produce an immersive effect. I found Spacecom even more exciting and involving than most triple-A games recently. I would highly recommend it to all people who like good games.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"http://de.ign.com/spacecom-pc/95403/review/review-zu-spacecom-strategie-kann-so-einfach-sein\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >IGN Deutschland</a><br><br>“Spacecom is simple, both graphically and mechanically—so simple it could almost be a board game.  And yet despite—or rather, because of—this unassuming exterior, there's a lot of depth for you to explore within a limited space. That's the kind of strategy I like! It's like playing an actual game of chess where each piece has a very defined set of rules versus a weird game of pseudo-chess where each pawn functions slightly differently and you won't really understand the point of half of them until you're fifty hours in.  We like to say &quot;Graphics don't matter! Graphics don't matter!&quot; Well, here's your proof. Just bring your imagination to the table, and there's a deeply satisfying strategy game waiting for you.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2684902/spacecom-review-a-rousing-game-of-strategy-between-a-bunch-of-triangles.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PC World</a><br><br>“Spacecom is exactly what I like. Challenging, smart, addictive, stimulating and yet not overloaded with unnecessary things. Flow Combine &amp; 11 bit studios production represents the real meaning of strategy games and it’s essence. Every single fan of this genre, not only those with space theme, should check Spacecom.”<br>8,5/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://gry.onet.pl/recenzje/spacecom-recenzja-male-jest-piekne-a-jakie-madre/pw3gd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http://gry.onet.pl/recenzje/spacecom-recenzja-male-jest-piekne-a-jakie-madre/pw3gd</a><br>",

I like how you can drag PNG files into the game and it creates stuff. Only downsides is the physics need some work so people do not get stuck as often and maybe more saving progress with blueprints sicne it is tedious to get them every time I am on a new plantoid. Online multiplayer would make this game ALOT more funbecaucethere could be online pvp, story coop, sandbox, etc.",

(or not... check the bottom of the review for an edit I added)\n\nI bought this game because it reminded me of Cortex Command, which I played a long time ago. This game gave me the nostalgia of playing it again, but Cortex Command gives you everything at full price, this game is just as fun, until you finish the levels. In cortex command it would make sense to jump into the editor, make your own content for the game, create your own fun. Planetoid Pioneers instead stops you dead in your tracks and says you have to pay 3x as much to get those priviledges, and the game is mainly supported by the fanbase, which has only just started and will probably die just as soon. So if you want a full game that is cheaper, more customizable, and just as fun to play, if you're okay with lower graphics, just get Cortex Command.\n\nEDIT: If you've read this far, this was the first version of my review, the game is still in development and is gonna change after early access. Both versions of the game are gonna merge, I didn't know that, so now you can know too, it's a demo because it's not done, but it will be soon. So if you want something as good, or even better than cortex command, just wait a small bit and you'll get it.",

          "legal_notice": "Planetoid Pioneers<br>END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT [EULA]<br>v.1 [4-February-2016]<br><br>Data Realms would like to thank you for getting Planetoid Pioneers. We hope you enjoy the experience. But before you get started, we need to make some matters clear. When you paid for Planetoid Pioneers you did not actually buy the game. What you bought was a license to use the software that comprises the game and its related materials. And that license is subject to the terms of this EULA. This EULA is a binding contract between you and Data Realms and its licensors, licensees and suppliers. <br><br>We know you want to get the game installed and start playing it. But, please take the time to read through this agreement first because BY INSTALLING PLANETOID PIONEERS YOU ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 13 YEARS OLD, HAVE READ THIS EULA, AGREE TO ITS TERMS AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, PROMPTLY DISCONTINUE THE INSTALLATION PROCESS AND CEASE ANY AND ALL USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.<br><br>1. Limited Use License<br><br>Planetoid Pioneers software and any files that are provided with it by digital distribution or on tangible media, as well as any printed materials, patches or updates, (collectively referred to as “PP”) contains copyrighted material, trade secrets and other proprietary material of Data Realms and its licensors, licensees and suppliers. PP is licensed to you for your use. This license is a non-exclusive limited license to install and use PP yourself, including use over the internet or on a LAN. Your continuing license to use PP is conditioned on your compliance with this EULA. If you violate any of the terms of this EULA, all of your right to use PP will immediately end, without any further notification from Data Realms or anyone else. Once your license is terminated, you will be obliged to immediately uninstall PP and all of its components.<br><br>2. Permitted User Generated Content (“UGC”)<br><br>Planetoid Pioneers was designed from the ground up for UGC.  The Crush 2D Engine (“C2D”) comes with PP.  Once you agree to the Crush2D Engine License that you will see when you first launch the engine, you can use C2D to make blueprints, environments and pretty much anything else you might want to make (referred to as Packed PNG files, “PPNG” for short) to be used playing PP. You agree that you will not distribute or share the C2D engine because it is not shareware. You agree that any new PPNGs that you make for PP, with the C2D engine, are subject to the following restrictions:<br><br>* Your PPNGs must only work with the full, registered copy of PP, not independently or with any other software.<br><br>* Your PPNGs must not contain modifications to any executable file(s).<br><br>* Your PPNGs must not contain any sexually explicit, harmful, threatening, abusive, defamatory, obscene, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive imagery or libelous, defamatory, or other illegal material, material that is scandalous or invades the rights of privacy or publicity of any third party.<br><br>* Your PPNGs must not contain, or be used in conjunction with, any trademarks, copyright protected work, or other recognizable property of third parties without their written authority.<br><br>* Your PPNGs must not be used by you, or anyone else, for any commercial exploitation including, but not limited to, in-game advertising, other advertising or marketing for any company, product or service.<br><br>Unless selected for inclusion in the PP Steam Workshop or other PP store, PPNGs must be distributed for free, period. Neither you, nor any other person or party, may sell them to anyone, commercially exploit them in any way, or charge anyone for receiving or using them without prior written consent from Data Realms. You may exchange them at no charge among other end users and distribute them to others over the Internet or otherwise for free.<br><br>The prohibitions and restrictions in this section apply to anyone in possession of PP or any PPNGs.<br> <br>Data Realms wholeheartedly supports UGC for PP. But we need to retain all of our ownership rights in PP and any works derived from PP. That's just the way it is. So, go make some more cool stuff. But remember that you do not gain any ownership whatsoever in any PP content nor can you use any PP content outside the scope of the rights granted here. <br><br>3. Make Money from Your UGC<br><br>Data Realms will be selling UGC through Steam Workshop and elsewhere (the Store”) to other individuals that have PP.  We will be working with the community to select the top rated UGC for sale.  If one or more of your PPNGs are selected for inclusion in the Store, it will be up to you whether you want us to sell it for you or if you want to continue to distribute it for free.  If you do want us to include it in the Store you will receive a portion of the revenue derived from the distribution of your PPNG.  Prior to inclusion in the Store you may need to agree to some additional terms as required by Steam or our other partners, in order to distribute PP PPNGS on their respective platforms.<br><br>4.  Commercial Exploitation<br><br>You may not use PP, or any PPNGs created for or from PP or using the C2D engine or any other tools provided with this PP, for any other commercial purposes without the prior written consent of Data Realms or its authorized licensees including, but not limited to, the following rules: 1. If you are the proprietor of an Internet café or gaming room, you may operate the PP in a “pay for play” environment provided that all computers used have validly licensed PP installed, such PP having been properly purchased through one of our licensees. 2. You may not, without prior written consent from Data Realms, operate the PP in any gaming contest where (a) the cash value of all winnings and prizes paid throughout the entire competition is equal to or greater than US$1,000.00 or (b) the name of the event, or any individual contest therein, incorporates or approximates the name of a company, product or commercial service or (c) any company has provided, whether donated or as sponsorship any prizes, products or services worth with a fair market value of over US$2,000.00. <br><br>4. Restrictions on Use<br><br>Just to make sure you understand what you can and cannot do with PP and the C2D Engine, here is a list of restrictions to your use of PP under this EULA:<br><br>* You may not decompile, modify, reverse engineer, publicly display, prepare derivative works based on PP (except as permitted in Section 2, above), disassemble or otherwise reproduce PP or the C2D Engine.<br><br>* Except as set forth herein, you may not rent, sell, lease, barter, sublicense or distribute PP. You may not delete the copyright notices or any other proprietary legends on the original copy of PP. <br><br>* You may not offer PP on a pay per play basis or otherwise commercially exploit PP or use PP for any commercial purpose except as described in this agreement.<br><br>* You may not electronically transmit PP from one computer to another or over a network except as described in this agreement.<br> <br>5. Export Controls<br><br>You may not ship or export PP or the C2D Engine to any country other than where you bought it, in violation of the U.S. Export Administration Act (or any other law governing such matters) and you will not utilize and will not authorize anyone to utilize PP or the C2D Engine in violation of any applicable law. PP or the C2D Engine may not be downloaded or otherwise exported into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the U.S. has embargoed goods or to anyone or into any country who/which are prohibited by applicable law, from receiving it.<br><br>6. Abusive Behaviors<br><br>We will not tolerate anyone using the game, or any servers or forums provided for the game, to be continually or repeatedly abusive to other players. This includes, but is not limited to, \"griefing,” racist bigotry, sexism or any other forms of \"cyber bullying.” If we find you are a Cheater or Abusive, we will revoke your CD key and ban you from PP and tell your mom! Your license will automatically terminate, without notice, and you will have no right to play PP, use the C2D Engine or make any other use of PP. End of story.<br><br>7. Intellectual Property Rights.<br><br>PP, the C2D Engine and all copyrights, trademarks and all other conceivable intellectual property rights related to the PP or the C2D Engine are owned by Data Realms or its licensors, licensees or suppliers and are protected by United States copyrights laws, international treaty provisions, and all applicable laws, such as the Lanham Act. PP must be treated like any other copyrighted material, as required by 17 U.S.C. #101 et seq. and other applicable law. Please do not make unauthorized copies. PP and the C2D Engine were created through the efforts of many people who earn their livelihood from its lawful use. Please don’t make copies for others who have not paid for the right to use it. To report copyright violations to the Software Publishers Association, call 1 800 388 PIR8 or write: Software Publishers Association, 1101 Connecticut Ave., Suite 901, Washington, D.C. 20036.<br><br>8.

Limitation of Liability<br><br>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING WILLFUL ACTS OR NEGLIGENCE, SHALL DATA REALMS OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, LICENSORS, LICENSEES, SUBLICENSEE, SUPPLIERS OR ASSIGNS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR RELATED DOCUMENTATION, EVEN IF SUCH PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES. THERE WILL BE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY, EVEN SELF INFLICTED INJURY, OR FOR ANY INTENTIONAL TORT COMMITTED BY YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON WHO PLAYS OR OBSERVES SOMEONE ELSE PLAYING PP. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall our total liability to you for all damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) exceed the amount paid by you for PP.<br><br>10. Controlling Law and Severability <br><br>This license is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, USA. Exclusive venue for all litigation shall be in King County, Washington. If any provision of this EULA is determined to be unenforceable by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction, such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining portions of this EULA will remain in full force and effect.<br><br>11.

And any other games that look like this, I always bring up LIMBO and am reminded of LIMBO. The aesthetics of this game was so unique to me when I first saw it, and that was years ago when I didn't even have steam yet. I watched so many different gameplays of this when it first came out because it was just that exciting and intriguing and unique. It definitely opened up a path for a new genre of games and I'm very happy it did. I already know how the game goes but I still bought it anyways because I wanted to support the company because they deserve it.",

      "summary": "Between our world and the world beyond lie the Titan Souls, the spiritual source and sum of all living things. Now scattered amongst the ruins and guarded by the idle titans charged with their care, a solitary hero armed with but a single arrow is once again assembling shards of the Titan Soul in a quest for truth and power.",
      "storyline": "Titan Souls tells the story of a nameless warrior’s quest to bring down the ancient titans with nothing but a single, indestructible arrow. There are no lesser classes of enemies, no crafting, no grinding and no side quests -- just you and the two dozen titans scattered throughout the land awaiting your challenge.",

You can roll, and run and avoid that slime ( because it slows you down ) \n\nOnce you beat the first four bosses, the game REALLY opens up into a huge expansive world with tons of bosses to fight, and the difficulty never lets up.\n\nIt is very well made, the sprites are beautiful - the concept is unique to a point ( no pun intended ) \n\nOriginally I hated this , but after I beat the first four bosses, and saw what came next - i was hooked.\n",

Also, the art style and music are beautiful.\n\nBut after barely beating the first 4 bosses (some of which I cheesed), and being destroyed many times by the next few I tried, I have to say this is not my kind of game. I might try playing it again here and there, but nothing continual as the constant deaths and walking back gets annoying quickly. Also, the controls are absolutely terrible. I had to get a key remapping program just to be able to function properly, and I suggest doing the same.",

But each time I played it I learned something new about the boss that helped me ultimately defeat it. Then after it fell, I thought it was odd that nothing seemed to change. No new unlocks, weapons, or mechanics. Nothing. Then I awoke the second boss and BAM! I'm dead. I had to beat two other bosses to cool down before trying him again, and he still destroyed me several times first. I made my friend play it, and he beat it his first go. \n\nAs someone who has played Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Shadow of the Colossus, Dark Souls, and other similar, grueling, bloody difficult, boss-centric games, I can definitely say this is not a rip off of any of those (even if one of the fights is almost directly taken from Shadow of the Colossus). This is an homage, and a good on at that. \n\nIt gets the atmosphere down perfect, plopping you into a world that is both interesting and silent about its own origins, leaving you, the player, to do your best to infer what the hell this world is. This simplicity in world and the equally simple nature of you mission - find and kill bosses - is also reflected in the design and mechanics. You can move around, and you have two buttons. One fires your bow and summons your arrow back, and one causes you to perform a dodge-roll. When you hold the roll button you run faster. That is it. But it is the way those mechanics intaract with the world around you that is both so interesting AND crucial to defeating bosses. \n\nOh and as an after thought, the designs of the bosses (most of them anyway) are interesting, but they are just as simple as you. You die in one hit, but so do they. Finding their weak spot and figuring out how best to approach and hit that weak spot is not only fun, but fitting with the simple motif of \"less is more\". \n\nI payed 3.75 for this, instead of 15. But, I would gladly pay that full price for this game, which not only offers me fun and interesting boss fights that I want to beat no matter how times I die, but keeps me going just to see what the next one looks like. I am not even finished (stuck on that plant monster in the trailer. 30+ deaths and counting) and I still can't wait to jump back in and see what else this game has to throw at me!\n\nBy the way, this game is hard and you will die a lot. Just letting those of you who get easily frustrated know. I was dying and shouting \"GOD DAMMIT! I HATE THIS! THIS GAME IS SO GOOD!\"",

The good things are good enough for me to ignore the bad things now that i'm done with it, but frustration was present during my playthrough.\n\nThe concept: \nThere are only boss fights, you die from one hit and so does the boss if its weak point is hit. This makes it a very challenging game\n\nGood things: \n-Most bosses provide you with good clues about its weak point and how to hit it as long as you are observant. Sometimes it even feels like you are playing some kind of skill-based puzzle. Once you figured out how to exploit a bosses weakness it becomes a quest for the perfect run to win. A perfect run might take like 5 seconds even though you've spent like half an hour on the same boss. Weird, but cool and unique.\n-The music is amazing\n-It's beautiful\n\nBad things:\n-The world is built as if you are meant to explore it, but there is nothing to find really. All you want is to find the next boss, not mystical paintings on rocks that just acts like red herrings in the end. Looks cool though, i guess.\n-Some bosses are hidden in unclear ways, which also adds to the bad things about the exploration.\n-It's a top down-view in mostly 2d graphics. But some bosses uses 3d movement by moving in the air before attacking from above. This semi-3d movement sometimes becomes hard to read from a top-down perspective in an intense boss-fight. Causing you to feel like you died because you misread whether a spiky limp was in the air or not, or if a flying rock fist was slamming down or just moving\n\nWhat could be improved?\nAside from the bad things mentioned, the boss fights feels a bit short once you actually beat them. BUT there is one boss that has multiple phases. Each phase is still won with just one perfect strike, but each perfect strike causes the boss to take on a new form, so it became longer while not breaking the games concept. This fight was so damn amazing and i wish there was more of it!",

              "review": "Fun game, reminds me a lot of Shadow of the Colossus. Every enemy dies in one hit, and it's fun to try and figure out how to hit their weak point.\n\nTwo big problems though. \n\n1, you will die a lot and although that's fine, each death means about a 15 second walk back to the arena. I find this really grating as you also die in 1 hit, and you will spend a lot of deaths learning a boss's weaknesses. \n\n2, Many bosses I've fought so far (about 5 out of the 8) are very confusing initialy as what you need to even do. This can be frustrating when you spend 15-20 seconds getting to their arena, only to die immediately because it's unclear what you're supposed to be doing. Part of the fun I admit is figuring this stuff out, but when it's been 20 deaths it isn't fun anymore.\n\nAll in all I recommend the game, it's fun, but it could be vastly improved with better checkpoints.\n",

Up to 4 players locally with no login on one game license.  Simple to learn with a high skill-cap (do you dance with the Ghost?).  Rock-solid bug-free app.  Co-op is complex and dangerous.  The co-op ghost mechanic which occurs when a co-op person dies and becomes a ghost until a resurrection coffin is found is valid and interesting and surprising and deep (a co-op ghost can fend off the Ghost indefinitely).  100 hours in, I still have a lot to learn.  Has a tiny number of items compared to similarly-amazing games like The Binding of Isaac, but is no less great for it.  I am a child of the 80's and this is would have been a legend had it released then.\n\nTry the original free pixelated version if you have questions.  It contains all of the foundations of this game except 4-player co-op.\n\nWhen is Spelunky 2 released?",

              "review": "Disregard my play time record on steam. I have poured hundreds of hours into Spelunky on xbox. This game is hard, unforgiving, frustrating, and overall an adventure. I've had over 1,000 playthroughs and about three wins total (not taking any shortcuts). The thing to keep in mind, especially before you purchase this game- is that Spelunky is a roguelike. The purpose of the game isn't to win; the purpose of the game is to try. I can't tell you how many times I've been in a run with a whole arsenal of items at my disposal and the odds seemingly in my favor... and then I die in some stupid way. But once you get over the initial learning curve and develop a strategy that works for you- you'll learn to love the challenge. For me, I always killed the shopkeeper and used his shotgun to force my way through any situation. A run can last you anywhere from 10-20 minutes, and if you get super lucky and \"git gud\", you'll get to see where all those hours of failed runs would have got you had you survived: a notsohard boss fight and moment of realization that the game was always about the adventure, not the destination.\n\nBasically, this game provides good replayability and a lot of frustration. What else would you expect from a roguelike? Oh, and one quick word of advice from a console peasant! Use a controller; the keyboard is harder to use... You'll see.",

But there are small things here that I just can't get over.\n\nNow first, the pros:\n\n+Theres an obvious learning curve. I may not be able to get over it, but hey, It's there.\n+It nails the rouge-like feel. I haven't gotten a level that is even remotely similar and I have ye tto get past the 3rd section of level 1.\n+(MOSTLY) Tight controls. Its easy to do what you want, and its floaty in the right places.\n+The powerups are awesome. Give me all of he spider web guns.\nCan't really say much more because of how far I got in the game.\n+The music isn't spectacular, but it fits really nice with the whole \"Exploration\" theme.\n\nMinor gripes:\n\n=I don't like the cliff hanging. Maybe I'm spoiled by other games, but when I press up, i want to just climb up, not have to actually jump up. \n=Obstacle spamming. I want to say this might be bad luck, but I've had levels were there were 3-4 arrow traps along the same path, which was the needed one to get to the tunnel and leave, or maybe to rescue the damsel in distress. And yes I realise I can just drop something to trigger them, I also cant count how many times I've been fucked over by  something pushing me into them.\n\nLike I said, just minor things I don't like. Now for some real issues I have.\n\nCons:\n-The ghost. I dont like the ghost. I want to freely explore the underground, but the ghost restricts this by having a forced timer. I would hav ebeen fine if it was just the resource management.\n-There is a bug where if you close out of the game, by the red X, then the game still thinks that its running despite being closed. This becomes VERY annoying if your music isnt turned off, because you can't turn it off.\n\nLook, I just wanna say: I can see why people like this game. I really do.\nIt's jus tnot for me. Thats why I reccomend this game, if it's for you.",

You'll have complete freedom while you navigate the fully-destructible environments and master their many secrets. To stay or flee, to kill or rescue, to shop or steal... in Spelunky, the choice is yours and so are the consequences!\"\n\nIt's bullsh*t.\n\nThis game is not about exploring, not about collecting treasures, not about rescue – it's only about speedrun.\n\nActually, it's \"Mario\" - you have to reach exit in limited time (and you can kill enemies jumping on their heads!). The difference is only that when time is out, you don't immediately die but instead a huge invinsible ghost is spawned somewhere on level and chases you (and instakills you on touch). Oh, and another tiny detail – there is no timer on screen. So you never know how much time do you have.\n\nIn practice this means that you have to run to exit as fast as you can, only gathering things which are right on your way. Want to explore level? Want to reach that remote locked room with a lot of gems? Want to find a merchant to finally spend your money? Want to resque a traveller (to heal yourself)? Want to bring resqued traveller not to exit right before you but to Kali altar on the another end of level? Fine! Go there! And see how ghost is spawned right before the only exit from a room you just entered. Or before exit from level in the very corner of the map, so you can't bypass him anyhow. And then you die. Just because of random, that generated a deadlock situation.\n\"To stay or flee, to kill or rescue, to shop or steal\"... – the choice is not yours, the choice belongs only to map generator.\n\nSure, with practice you'll definitely be able to fly through level fast and devastating as living tornado and will never reach time limit. Of course. But know what? IT'S NOT AN EXPLORING! It's a damn speedrun. Run, run, run, always remember about time. It's not the game I expected.\n\n> \"You'll have complete freedom while you navigate the fully-destructible environments and master their many secrets\"\n\nYeah... complete freedom... time-limited complete freedom.\n\nOh, also about \"fully-destructible environments\". Well, they are destructible. With bombs. You have some limited amount of bombs, and you should find or buy more to keep yourself able to destroy environment. Because you are spelunker that CAN'T DIG (need to buy a special item for this). And the deeper you go, the more you'll need to use bombs only as weapon - because monsters are strong and traps are numerous and deadly (up to instakill, again). That is, in practice – forget about \"fully-destructible environments\", just run where you see a path – exit is ALWAYS available without need to destroy walls, only treasures and travellers can be completely locked up. So just run. Run, run, run.\n\nSo. If you, like me, came here to EXPLORE dungeons, crawling, digging and thinking how to better destroy walls to create optimal path – it's not the game you're looking for.\nI don't say the game is bad (although I can't imagine what kind of masochist can like to run 5-10 minutes just to die from another oneshot). It looks very nice, it consumes your time as hell, and probably you can trully master it so there is a reason to play... it's not a BAD game.\nBut it totally deceives you with it's description. As a result – a big disappointment, because it's not that kind of gameplay which I expected. And because of disappointment I dislike it.\n\n\nupd. It appears, that game I was looking for is \"SteamWorld Dig\". Exactly what I wanted.",

Graphics are pretty good for what it is.\nDefinitely worth the price tag is you want a casual game to mess around in with friends. Very gauntlet feel.\n\nOnly issue I had might have been due to my controller. As I use a PS4 controller, whenever I click join it brings in two characters and I have to move one off the platform to drop one of them. Not sure if an intentional feature or not. Not really a big issue either way.\n\nI would like to see more modes added to it aside from the only co-op+VS mode.",

I'm also always looking for good local-coop games to play together with my two boys.\n\nTechnically, the game is flawless.  Smooth fast graphics, highly responsive, no lag, great sound and pretty pictures.   Also, I've always enjoyed rogue-like games and this was a nice twist.\n\nUnfortunately, that's about it in terms of gameplay.  Not to be crass, but it feels like a school group project - a roguelike game made by committee that's a mile wide and an inch deep.  Like any game, once the pretty pictures wear off, there needs to be something of substance behind it.  Even the original nethack games had a leveling system - and with good reason!  You need some reason to keep playing and go for just one more dungeon.   More than 4 monsters and a few bosses would be a good start. \n\nI guess it's easier to give a school grade for solid graphics and technical savvy then it is to judge depth or playability.  And having the goal of publishing to Steam is a good carrot to motivate students to meet a deadline I suppose. \n\nMy boys (8 & 10 yo) had fun with the novelty of the game for about 15 minutes.  But once they realized that there was only more of the same around each corner, they lost interest quick - and so did I.",

I thought I'd like the Knight the most, but so far the Archer is my favorite. It's not as good close up, but if you can get some distance and find an area to bottleneck the enemies, it's good for crowd control. Generally, I go room to room, then try and find either a boss, treasure, or an area to keep them at bay so I can rack up health drops. Overall it's definitely fun, but I think it's more suited towards playing with your friends. It's very difficult to play by yourself, but still fun. The music really puts a punctuation on everything and is really great. I'd love to see a few more modes and levels eventually, maybe even a campaign like a Spyro-esque mode where you teleport to different worlds and fight their bosses, but I understand that's a lot more work for the future. Great game and definitely recommending.",

It’s bullet-hell beat-em-up meets old-school RPG, in an arcadey party-game for up to 4 players. One player is the hero, exploring a randomly generated dungeon full of traps and monsters - all controlled by the other players. If you slay the hero you take their place and it’s your turn to crawl! Then it's a race to gain enough XP and loot to reach the final battle, where it's all on one as the other players collectively control the hulking final boss!",

      "summary": "Freeway is a video game designed by David Crane for the Atari 2600 video game console. It was published by Activision in 1981. One or two players control chickens who can be made to run across a ten lane highway filled with traffic in an effort to \"get to the other side.\" Every time a chicken gets across a point is earned for that player. If hit by a car, a chicken is forced back either slightly, or pushed back to the bottom of the screen, depending on what difficulty the switch is set to. The winner of a two player game is the player who has scored the most points in the two minutes, sixteen seconds allotted. The chickens are only allowed to move up or down. A cluck sound is heard when a chicken is struck by a car. Comparisons are often made to Frogger, which has also features crossing a street filled with moving vehicles. Similarities did help sales when Frogger was popular in the arcades and a home version was not yet available. \n \nFreeway was made available on Microsoft's Game Room service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows-based PCs on August 18, 2010.",

      "summary": "SOMA is a sci-fi horror game from Frictional Games, creators of the groundbreaking Amnesia and Penumbra series. \n \nThe radio is dead, food is running out, and the machines have started to think they are people. Underwater facility PATHOS-II has suffered an intolerable isolation and we’re going to have to make some tough decisions. What can be done? What makes sense? What is left to fight for? SOMA is a sci-fi horror game from Frictional Games, the creators of Amnesia: The Dark Descent. It is an unsettling story about identity, consciousness, and what it means to be human.",
      "storyline": "The radio has gone silent on PATHOS-2. As isolation bears down on the staff of the remote research facility, strange things are happening. \n \nMachines are taking on human traits and alien constructions have started to interfere with routine. The world around them is turning into a nightmare. \n \nThe only way out is to do something unimaginable.",

SOMA is an exceptional masterpiece.\n\nQuite a few of the single elements in this game are probably similar to things you have seen, read or watched somewhere else before. There is not all that much to do in terms of gameplay and puzzles. The levels are quite small by today´s standards and everything is mostly linear. It is not very challenging to finish and you will likely spend not much more than 10 hours to see the story through.\n    \nAfter an innocuous intro level you awake in an atmospheric and slightly creepy little dungeon (which initially looks and feels similar to a deserted vault from a Fallout game) and start to find out where you are and what has happened. \n\nThis game achieves something that is very rare. Before you know it, you seamlessly become immersed into a story that makes you question the very fundamentals of what it means to be alive, conscious, human and to have a purpose in life. Amazingly, this is done without the slightest hint of grandiosity, nudging, judgement or lengthy exposition on deep philosophical principles – just by exploring the world and discovering piece by piece where you are and what has happened as you move on to find a way out from the place.\n\nTl; dr:  SOMA is a deeply moving and profound experience, delivered effortlessly in an almost minimalistic way. Outstanding.",

The overall atmosphere of the game is so dark and creepy, and I loved that. It's kinda like scifi-horror version of BioShock. Just by the fact that you're under the sea got me anxious lol. But anxious in a good way.\n\nSOMA has pretty much like Amnesia style of gameplay. I don't know is it just me, but there were parts where you were kinda left on your own to think what you should do. Kind of like where you should go and what you should be doing. Because there are no objective markers or anything. You just kinda have to figure everything out by yourself.\n\nIn general, I really like this game and I would recommend this to anyone who is into scifi-horror and post-apocalyptic stuff.",

              "review": "Thank god for developers like Frictional Games, that are willing to take the risk and time to explore more complex themes and ideas. SOMA isn't perfect, but once the screen fades to black for the last time it makes up for any deficit. It sets an impossible standard for most indie developers.\n\nThis was not the game I was expecting. If, like me, you have only glimpsed some early build trailers, then the design has clearly changed. Placed underwater, amongst the remains of humanity, you must come to grips with almost a century of change, and ultimately redefine the term human. Talking robots, mechanized humans and corrupted marine life all play their role in convincing you that something has gone horribly wrong. \n\nFrictional maintain a number of elements from their previous outings, including physics based puzzles. Almost any object can be grabbed, dropped and thrown; levers can be pulled; wheels can be twisted; doors pulled or pushed open. The concept lends a welcome tactile nature to the story which, sadly, falls back on a familiar trope: your all alone, EXCEPT for a voice to guide you. While you identify the owner of the voice, and ultimately take on their objective as your own, it still feels like a commitment to revealing the story through environment and atmosphere would have strengthened the isolation, making searching out information a puzzle in itself. \n\nThe look and setting of SOMA will bring obvious comparisons to Bioshock, but it's tenuous link at best. Skulking through the confined, industrialized corridors of Pathos II feels far removed from the Art Deco inspired, living spaces afforded to Rapture. No guns and plasmids, only exploring and hiding. \n\nWorth a special mention is the sound design, music and voice acting. Certain games lend themselves to headphones more than others, and you would be doing a disservice not to use them in this case. The effect is universally excellent in creating a sense of place, whether the groan of stressed metal or the muted, calm of the seafloor. \n\nPrevious Frictional releases have relied on enemies to provide constant tension and scares, leaving you cowering in darkened corners. SOMA's mechanized enemies don't appear as frequently, and tend to be solo when they do, but I personally found them to be frustrating. My main issue was their completely random nature. In one example I was left with the enemy blocking my only way forward, unresponsive to sound or light, and refusing to budge until I ran at it, died and restarted past that point. While they are fitting to the story and environment, I couldn't help but feel they may not have been necessary, and instead the developer felt pressured to include them.\n\nThere are some other issues, I experienced, that may or may not concern others. Loading times are looooong (up there with The Witcher 3), with intermittent loading occuring at strange intervals. Pacing is slower in the first half than the more compelling second. Objectives are not marked which leads to wandering and backtracking trying to find items and puzzles to solve. \n\nThe best test of the success of an idea is how it stays with you afterward. Like Life Is Strange, SOMA has remained with me since finishing, debating the choices I made and trying to reconcile the events into chronological order. It's Frictional's best story yet, offering a rich message that never takes away from the terror of playing. In fact, that message questioning what it means to be human, is SOMA's most terrifying element. The game isn't perfect, none are, but if an amazing story, wrapped in an absorbing atmosphere and sprinkled with puzzles is your thing, then it's an easy choice.",

Are we simply a collection of electrical impulses? Can and should our “self” be cloned? Soma is worth playing through for the story alone.\n\nThe atmosphere is suitably chilling and claustrophobic, although the levels are somewhat linear in design. The monsters encounter system copies the Alien Isolation idea but doesn’t quite pull it off well enough. Getting past a monster can feel frustrating at times, but overall it doesn’t detract too much from the gameplay.\n\nThe voice acting is excellent and the whole experience feels like an interactive movie. Totally recommended to fans of creepy, intelligent science fiction.\n",

              "review": "I rarely write reviews even though I read them a lot (sorry), but after playing SOMA, I felt I had to speak up.\n\nI've been playing video games since Pong came out (yes, I'm THAT old).\nIn the past I primarily played RPGs and dungeon crawlers because that's all there was. I've never liked racing or sports games or Mario-style platformers and side-scollers.\nMost of the time now, I play FPS or FPS/RPG games - like Half-Life, FEAR, Dead Space, Prey (original and new), Fallout 4, Borderlands, Wolfenstein....you get the idea - a little plot, a lot of action and killing (yay!).\n\nSince I've enjoyed many of the 'horror' style games, I recently tried Layers Of Fear and thoroughly enjoyed it - but that's for another review.\n\nHere's the thing - usually the stories are rehashes of every other game - Bad Mega Corporation created some nasty goop and tested it on humans thereby making monsters? Ok, yeah, again, fine.\nAliens came here to colonize the planet and brought the goop with them? Sure, of course, I know this one.\nThe character acting, while sometimes quite good, still leaves me not caring one bit about them. Gotta kill a 'partner' to save another? Uh-huh, why not, who cares? \n\nAs another example, I started playing Elex and I'm about 20 hours into it. I finally got to the point where my character was\nable to protect himself from many other creatures, but it rapidly became an exercise in making way too many 'moral choices'.\nI stopped playing because it wasn't fun or exciting - it became a chore. Work your way through the dialog tree, then get some action for a few minutes, then find another character and spend 10 minutes working another dialog tree. Hours of walking and talking. Yuk.\nIn a similar way, I couldn't play Fallout 3 because it was just talk talk talk talk talk do something talk talk talk...\n\nSOMA is not like that - at all. It's more linear, well structured, well written, and well acted. It can be creepy as hell,\nbut mostly it's dark, lonely, sad, and thought provoking. I know that doesn't make it sound good or fun, but it really is.\nThere's no dialog tree - it's scripted so talking to another character means listening to them have a conversation.\nIt's not a totally original plot line (what is?) but it takes a different philosophical angle on a fairly common 'things went wrong' idea. This helps, I think - it keeps it familiar enough to be comfortable while still pushing you to think about something more than just where the next demon is.\n\nI found something different with SOMA. While the acting was mostly quite good (some characters much better than others), it was the dialog and basic plot that I found intriguing - Can you still be human without your flesh and blood body?\nAs I approached the end, I actually had some feelings for the characters. At one point you have to decide how to handle a\ndying character, one that you just met, and I found it way more emotional than I ever expected. At the very end, I was surprised that I was actually sad for the main character and sad the game ended.\n\nOK, enough said about plot - if you check the discussions, you'll see pages of actual conversations discussing the philosophical implictions that SOMA presents, unlike I've seen for most games.\n\nOne more thing to note - I've been a SCUBA diver since 1974, and this is by far the best underwater representation I've seen.\nThere's no attempt to make it look like Finding Nemo (bright colors to look fun) - colors are muted and pale unless a light is shined directly on them, currents push you around, the coral growth is varied between a few years and decades, light doesn't travel far, and water is full of life no matter how small. Clearly, whomever did the design work has spent time diving, diving deep, and diving at night (or at least researching it well). I have only one criticism - moving underwater is still more laborious than shown, but you can't run from a monster if can't 'run' !\n\nSo, if you want a creepy but thought-provoking experience, try it.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

              "review": "Basically, soma sells itself as a survival horror game. Something akin to outlast or alien isolation, (which are two games that show the true experience of immersion and interest in the plot through subtle themes and methodical gameplay) but Soma does the exact opposite. Instead of starting slowly, methodically and predictably, soma starts by thrusting upon the player a crazy turn of events which is immersive at first since we get to learn from the perspective of the protagonist who's just as lost as we are, but in the first 3 hours of gameplay the mystery is explained and the rest of the plot is spoon fed to you by the game's main supporting character. It seems at first to be quite scary, but immediately transitions into \"isn't this existential stuff DEEP?\" And oversells this, again and again to the point where it feels like I've puked in my mouth and swallowed it.\n\nThe plot is basically \"go to place to complete game, get past interruptions and don't die.\" That's it, there's nothing else to it. Instead of feeling like \"oh what an adventure this will be!\" after the prologue, it's more like \"I have to move this slowly for the rest of the game?\" The \"puzzles\" are either easy and a bit of fun or overly annoying to the point where I have to alt-tab to google chrome and figure out what to do. The survival horror aspect is arguably the weakest part of the game. Slow-moving or stupid monsters that can either be easily evaded by, wait for it, STANDING STILL or even more easily outrun in some cases. Soma ISN'T scary in the slightest. The monster design is basic and uninteresting, the enemy AI is predictable and not stimulating and the atmosphere of the entire game doesn't make one feel unsettled or scared in any way. Near the halfway point I felt entirely annoyed and bored by the enemies, whereas in Outlast or alien isolation, my first instinct on hearing footsteps was to run and hide in hopes I can live long enough to progress. Not to see the next cutscene that's supposed to \"make me feel something.\"\n\nThere is the \"existentialist\" point to the game and this is also arguably the weakest part. Basically, the protagonist is a robot that used to be human and is currently stuck in an underwater facility and he's trying to get out. Without spoiling anything, there's several points where you have to choose to destroy a simulated consciousness, and the characters seem to be totally uninterested and simply react to the realization that it's happening, without much actual input. Anyway, not being a complete twat, I chose not to kill the simulated people. I thought there would be some sort of payoff but there's literally no difference in the ending you get. As for the \"philosophical\" parts, it's like rehashing how to solve 2+2 after the first time the plot demands it. \"robots with consciousness. Are they human?\" Yes, no, whatever the hell you want, even if you haven't read any philosophy it's not hard to understand the idea of consciousness and it doesn't leave you feeling any different after you finish the game.\n\nWhile I can appreciate this kind of narrative in a game, but Soma just takes itself too seriously, acting like it's the only thing in existence to quiestion what it means to be human. It's like a bag of movie theater popcorn. Nice at first, but after a little more than halfway through you get a bit sick. Soma's interesting at first, but loses it's complexity very quickly and isn't at all interesting after the fact but keeps up the act like it's a dancer who's completely forgotten the act and ends up being insultingly mediocre before the ending that just sort of \"happens\" and doesn't raise any questions besides \"oh what a cliffhanger! I wonder what happens next!\" because it doesn't matter. I rate this game 5/10.",

This is not exactly an horror game like amnesia or outlast. This is very thrilling and keeps your nerves up throughtout the game.\nThe sound mixing is one of the best pros of the game it gives you a sense of fear throughout the game.\nThe gameplay is simple as expected.\nThe concept of the game is good and the ending is also well done.\nThose who love to play an game which keeps your nerves up, go for SOMA without any doubt. Don't expct it to be a regular horror game type, its not. The story is also crisp and short.\nEnjoy the game!!!!!!",

              "review": "So when I bought this game I was sort of expecting a horror game. Turns out it is really not, so if that's the picture you've gotten so far then let me destroy that for you. Don't get me wrong: It has it's creepy and scary moments but no jumpscares or extremely scary tense situations like you'd have them in regular horror games. If you play this in the dark you don't really get scared at a single point during the game, some parts even felt more like an adventure game than a horror game.\nInstead SOMA is an extremely story heavy game which it does really well. Plays a bit like those interactive novels but in a good way.\nThe ending is especially well thought out and really makes you wonder what is real and what isn't. Didn't expect the plot to turn this way but I am very positively surprised after having finished it.\n\nWhat I also really think is positive about the game is the way how you can actually save when you exit and you continue right at the point where you've left while the loading screen quickly briefs you on how the story progressed so far and what your next task is.\n\nThe only downsides I could find to this game were the god damn f*cking monsters. I found they were EXTREMELY unnecessary and just immersion breaking. Yes I get that you need at least [i]some[/i] gameplay in your game, but they are more often than not just frustrating to deal with. Some of them are extremely easy to get around like a monster in the server room which was very easy to deal with, while others (especially the last two) are extremely f*cking obnoxious and annoying to deal with. So annyoing in fact, I couldn't be bothered to deal with them anymore so I just looked for walkthroughs on the internet literally just because it annoyed me to such an extend. I just wanted to progress the story further which I got really invested in really fast that these monsters seemed like a sh*tty excuse to throw obstacles at you and slow your progress down. Getting annoyed after your 3rd death to a monster already is just a generally bad sign. They were supposed to be immersive but broke my immersion more than anything else in the game.\nI'd recommend playing this game on the easy mode where monsters don't kill you to keep your frustration to a minimum. \n\nOther than that I can really recommend the game for you. It was a lot of fun to play and definitely worth the money.",

              "review": "From the great minds behind the spectacular and genre re-defining Amnesia comes another masterpiece in the field of psychological horror. You‘re put in the role of Simon Jarret, survivor of a car crash who has just woken up from a brain scan. But to your surprise, you woke up in a scientific outpost Pathos-II near the Mariana trench. The place is completely deserted and its corridors are filled with robots and other beings infected with cancerous rogue AI. Simon’s awakening is prefaced by a famous quote from Philip K. Dick: “Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.” This quote sets the whole feeling you’ll get from the game’s story. One of SOMA’s many mysteries is how did you even got into the facility and into the year 2105 from your brain scan back in Toronto in 2015.\nThe amount of high quality narrative is astounding. The story itself would make a great book. Now you can live through the story and be a part of it. You will encounter some serious and profound questions of both an ethical and philosophical nature. The way we perceive the world around us, our reality, SOMA will make you question everything. A lot of dread and horror comes from the story and the things you don’t see and not from the encounters with enemies. SOMA doesn’t need cheap jumpscares and gore like many modern horror games to make you scared or even scream. You can feel how mature have Frictional Games became.\n\tThe game itself plays well. The controls are intuitive and precise. One of Frictional Games’ trademarks is the interactivity they bring into their game worlds. You can pick up nearly everything, slide doors, open drawers and rummage through their contents. Of course, you will also run and try to hide from the horrors of Pathos-II. Encounters with your semi-organic enemies may, however, begin to be somewhat tedious for someone. You can’t fight them, the only thing you can try is to outsmart them and hide. You will cower in fear that your dark corner in which you’ve hidden yourselves will be discovered and even I found myself holding my breath not to give myself away. There are not many games that can do this.\n\tThe graphics and sound are spectacular. Desolated hallways with mechanical tentacles protruding from the walls. Even the smallest detail getting the attention it deserves. Loud gnarls or high-pitched shrieks of the monsters. Everything makes up for the great and dreadful atmosphere of desperation and isolation.\nSOMA is an ambitious work of science fiction which grapples with fundamental questions of consciousness, identity, and the relationship between the mind and the body. It will make you think about the way we perceive the world. The genre “Sci-Fi Horror” isn’t as exact as it may seem and it would be better to label it as a Philosophical Horror. It may not be for everyone due to its deep and mature story that makes you think. It feels weighty but never dry or ponderous thanks to an engaging and surprising story. I would definitely recommend it to anyone willing to think and ponder about life and its basic questions.\n",

It manages to keep the balance by switching from mere suspenseful to terrifying experiences, letting you interact with the environment provided in such fashion as to let you grasp a deeply disturbing reality, but then again in general terms that is what Frictional Games is best at.\n\nLet me then state what makes this game special among FG's works: As you get involved in the events that unfold, you realize that it's not only just monsters lying around and stealthing your way around them. It goes as deep as to provide a reflection on what makes one human, what is special about this \"humanity\" and in the worst scenario possible what is to be saved and what is to be left behind.",

              "review": "This game puts you in the position of an alien abtuctee that is tasked with manufacturing various constructions from supplied materials for your new masters. Your role is to design and construct the \"factory\" to make each construction. In order to prove that your process works, you must deliver 10 perfect copies of the requested item to a \"scanner\" that validates that each copy delivered is correct. As you progress, you are given additional tools, more challenging conditions/restrictions and more complicated items to assemble. \n\nI first learned about this game through a YouTube reference/review from Mark Brown's Game Maker's Tool Kit (search for it and watch it) that put this game in the genre of \"Problem-Solving\" rather than \"Puzzle-Solving\". The distinction is worth noting. This game allows you to develop many potential solutions to each problem - and rates you on the time, moving part and space efficiency of your solution in the form of showing your performance relative to that of all the other Steam players.\n\nYou have unlimited design time to develop your solutions, and, apart from the final level, there are no practical time limits to how long your solution can take. There's even an achievement (\"Subversive Engineering\") for the running time of your (successful) solution being a really long time. \n\nBecause you learn to use each new element one at a time, I never found the learning curve too intimidatingly steep, and the sense of reward when you solve a problem stage is strong. It is also possible to \"finish\" the game without completing all of the problem scenarios, in case there's one that you are having fits over.  \n\nI've put over 150 hours into this game. Not because it's difficult to complete, although some of the campaign puzzles can really stretch your brain, but because I've wanted to \"beat\" the efficiency requirements to get all the achievements and develop better solutions.\n\nAlthough there is Workshop support, I haven't done any of the Workshop levels yet. (I'm trying to work through other games in my library first...)",

I really want to write a good review of Infinifactory but I can't. \n\nMy problem with this game is while it is okay to make something have to think to come up with a solution, there is such a thing as making it too hard to figure out. Right from the first training puzzle, the thing I felt was missing that was not the case in other Zachtronic games was the needed components to construct the solution. Shenzhen IO, TIS/100 and SpaceChem always had enough of the basic elements -- motion, a grabber, and a switch -- to complete the problem. With infinifactory, the grabber -- which in this case would be a clamp -- was missing and it was sorely needed on the third training puzzle where I had to weld a vertical two-block stack, then move the union to the transporter. There was simply no way to join two falling objects at different altitudes into a union and then at command move the union to the transporter. I spent a total of 2 and a half hours on that one puzzle before finally giving up and uninstalling.\n\nWhen something becomes too hard to do, it stops being enjoyable. Infinifactory made the learning curve much too steep at the beginning and I truly feel it should have followed a more shallow incline demonstrated in the other games.",

      "summary": "Screencheat is a chaotic split-screen multiplayer shooter that forces players to rethink the way they approach conventional multiplayer games. In the Screencheat arena, fast reaction times aren’t enough to keep you alive. When everyone is invisible, players will have to master the art of taking a not-so sneaky look at their opponent’s screens and working out where they are based on uniquely coloured areas of the map and distinctive landmarks.\n\nScreencheat pays homage to iconic competitive first-person shooters such as Goldeneye, Perfect Dark and Halo, by blending the elements everyone loves about those games and shaking it up with its own unique take on the genre. When everyone’s used to playing by the rules, can you adapt to unconventional gaming quick enough to get the upper hand?",

The music is wonderful and the game isn't TOO hard or OVERLY cheap (as much as I hate 1 hit kill spikes, they aren't too plentiful).\n\nIt's short but it's pretty much the length of an NES game in which most of those you can finish in an hour or so. Got it on sale and I don't regret it.",

              "review": "Penarium is a pure platformer. No exploration, no shooting. Only moving and jumping. \n\nWhat else is there? A self-contained level whose borders you can cross to find yourself on the other side, and traps. Tons of traps that cycle during the duration of the level. Machine-guns, homing missiles, bubble-gum to make the platforms sticky while a see-saw journeys across… The goal of the game is to collect items that spawn in the level while avoiding different sets of traps. Simple, and yet effective.\n\nThis game is exactly what I was looking for. I am quite sick of the ‘muscle memory’ platformers where you have to learn by heart at which point of the level you jump, the perfect trajectory to land between spikes, and so on. Penarium focuses on the moment-to-moment frantic experience. Quick skills are required instead of a good finger memory, and it is rather telling that less than 20% of the players completed the 1st world. Penarium is very difficult, and as it sports a “sadistic circus” theme, you would have to be a masochist to like it. \n\nAnd yet I never found its difficulty to cross the “unfair” invisible line. The hitbox of the character is actually smaller than he looks. The movements are perfect, with double-jump and responsive controls without either the sliding momentum or the input delay that harm many platformers. The traps are more or less hard to avoid, but all can be predictable or give the player visual cues. But yeah, quick thinking and fast reflexes are mandatory. Oh, and I really appreciate that there is no timer adding an external pressure to the action. It is possible to either rush through the traps, or time them carefully. \n\nSo despite the high difficulty, moving like a madman and surviving amongst the chaos is exhilarating. It is fun. It does not feel like the game is punishing the player, because the action is constant and the threats come from everywhere while still being manageable. And the variety/movement of traps help make the game not feel repetitive. It can be finished in a few hours, and this type of game is not enjoyable if it gets much longer than that. To extend the fun, there is an endless mode with permanent progression.\n\nTo conclude, I was surprised to love this simple game so much more than the other hardcore platformers. I think it’s due to the good maneuverability, the difficult yet manageable design, and most of all the dynamic traps that require quick skills and provide a lot of fun by getting rid of the ‘muscle memory’ level design that usually goes with that kind of platformers.  \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=712733656\n",

Though I initially bought this just for the co-op and was slightly miffed to find this isn't the next Towerfall, it then turned out the game has a meaty single player and excellent arcade mode so no worries a ding ding dong.",

The gameplay is deceptively simple: all you do is jump between platforms. However, the different level goals, and the absurd amount of continuously changing trap combinations, force you to keep an eye on the entire screen and always keep you on your toes.\n\nThe campaign appears to be somewhat short, i seem to be over halfway through it within an hour of play, though your mileage may vary. Personally i feel that i got my money's worth, but you may want to keep that in mind. There is also an endless survival mode and a local multiplayer mode which further extend the game.\n\nI love everything about the game so far, from the gameplay, to the art, to the music, to the setting, and definitely recommend it.",

The music is fits nicely with the theme and the short span and the variety make it's tricky levels fun, replayable and well balanced. While certainly tough at times, the game always feels fair, the game has good weighty feel to it's physics and collision detection are great, when you die, which you will many many times, it's because you made a mistake.

There's something to be said for a game that can be completed in a single sitting, and never feel repetitive or like it's dragging its feet.\n\nI was going to criticise it for being simple. It is simple, but its simplicity is elegant. The combinations of its approximately 15 traps make for some beautifully intense and varied gameplay.\n\nI was going to criticise it for playing like a bonus challenge minigame at the end of a more fleshed-out game. It is reminiscent of a bonus challenge minigame, but unlike such games, it's well-designed, balanced, clever, and difficult to master.\n\nSo now, given the satisfying, challenging gameplay, beautifully realised pixel-art, and surprisingly engrossing setting and characters, I'm left with only one complaint:\n\nWhy is it that a rolling rock that could (and often will) crush me in an instant, does not crush the barrels I'm supposed to break!?",

      "summary": "Broken Age is a point-and-click adventure telling the stories of a young boy and girl leading parallel lives. The girl has been chosen by her village to be sacrificed to a terrible monster--but she decides to fight back. Meanwhile, a boy on a spaceship is living a solitary life under the care of a motherly computer, but he wants to break free to lead adventures and do good in the world. Adventures ensue.\n\nBroken Age development began when we asked our community if they would help us create a classic-style adventure game without needing to rely on traditional publishers. It turns out they did.\n\nAnd ever since day one, 2 Player Productions has been recording the whole process in an ongoing series of in-depth episodes documenting the creation of a game. Stay tuned for details on how to get your hands on it.",

Players explore fantastical environments, interact with different characters, and search for items to progress the story. A handful of sequences depict various acts of violence: a character firing lasers at a giant monster; characters engaging in hand-to-hand combat; a ship hit with exploding projectiles. One sequence depicts a large chum bucket filled with red blood-like liquid. During the course of the game, a character coerces a tree creature into vomiting tree sap into a bucket. The word “damn” is heard in the dialogue.",

Characterization is swept aside, the puzzles are tedious, and no satisfying resolution is presented to the story presented.  It feels like there should've been an Act III to really complete the game.  I don't regret playing it, necessarily, but neither would I necessarily recommend it to someone else.",

              "review": "only in Gaming Can you have CEO like Tim Schaffuer relentlessly denegrate and lie about the audience that not only purchases the product, but funds the entire thing (kickstarter). i could give this game a bad review and it would be justified because Tim openly lies about gamers, but truth is, i have integrity, so here we go:\n\n\nGAMEPLAY: as a point and click Adventure - this GAME is solid, no game breaking glitches, or unwinnable scenarios. This game has no deaths, and limited inventory items (which means fewer useless objects being hauled around). Where the game-play diverts from a traditional point and click, is there are no ' True timing based ' problems, meaning everything is sequential, so if a character watching something ' just gets back' that means you've missed a step or you're not doing the correct solution. Talking to characters, is also essential in solving problems, and the way the game is there are certain characters you need to talk with, talk to other characters, and THEN return to the character to open new dialouge. Most puzzles cannot be 'brute forced' or even 'logically/systematically' solved, so you may be wasting time taking excessive notes during gameplay. although to be fair during the 2nd act there are more logic/mind puzzles which are satisfying to finally solve. There are also a particular puzzle that is really Rigid, its a \"timing\" based sequence, but its very unforgiving, and its not clear what you are exactly trying to do, also there are elements that arent obvious to make it even more convelouted. you just have to repetatively perform the same task over and over until you see what exactly you're missing, then once you 'see it' you will have to suffer more frustration as you realize the timing aspect doesn't set you up to complete the sequence, with out some back and forth...\n\nthe length of the game feels about right for a $8 game. but $20 is outrageous, Thimbleweed park is a much better buy at that pricepoint.\n\n\nGRAPHICS/DESIGN: there is no real nostalgia factor here for the point-and-click genre, instead you have a 'storybook' motiff through out, that has animation like it came out of flash, now its much more sophisticated and polished, and it looks great. The characters are Cute, HOWEVER they did go cheap in that there are 2 missing Characters in the Game! they are referenced multiple times, you're even told they are in a room with other characters, but you never see them, even at the END of the game where everyone is reunited these two characters are not present, it totally breaks continuity and just is such a huge oversight.\n\n\n\n SOUND: The music is SIMPLY AMAZING, and the VOICE ACTING IS SPOT on!, The best character (NPC) in the game BY FAR is Curtis the Wood-Cutter, he deserves his own point-and-click adventure title. i am Dead serious, he is so charismatic and likable, and absolutely hilarious, its a shame that he doesn't have a bigger role in the game, but then sometimes less is more.\n\n\n\nSTORY: a lot of people bag on the story... i actually thought that the story was REALLY creative! its unlike any other point-and-click title out there, its Fun, engaging, but slow to start. I do have to say the ENDING was REALLY Poorly handled, it felt like a rush job / hurry up and wrap it up, type thing, very anticlimatic, there should have been a 3rd act as everyone else said. Also the Glaring issue of 2 characters who are referenced through-out the game never showing up (from the Cloud city) - oh well i guess they just DIED, they don't even have names, just birdgirl one and two.\n\n\nOVERALL: i would definitely put this game in the top 5 'New Point and click adventure games' one or two spots below thimbleweed park. i had fun playing it, and it was VERY SOLID despite its shortcomings.",

              "review": "Disclaimer: I played through the end of Act 1. I have not completed (or started) Act 2.\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with adventure games. I like the creativity and story-telling involved, but hate that most devolve into random \"guess what bizarre thing the designer was thinking\" puzzles.\n\nBroken Age (at least Act 1) was like that for me. The larger crime, however, is that I didn't find the story interesting or engaging. The end of Act 1 teases, I suppose, some coherence but really, for the most part you play as two different characters in two different worlds solving two entirely different sets of puzzles. I get that Act 2 may somehow tie these together, but after nearly 5 hours of Act 1, I just don't care.\n\nIf you love adventure games and don't mind a potentially dull story, give it a shot. Otherwise, move on as I have done.\n\nNot recommended: 2.5 out of 5.",

I have yet to play a game that disgusted me and disturbed me more than Outlast. Its eerie vibe is felt the moment you see the asylum, isolated from civilization and morality. The plot slowly descends into a hell of necrophilia, cannibalism and murder. Especially the Whistleblower DLC really proved how fearless the developers are in making this experience . I’ll admit I wasn’t blown away by the graphics at first until actually started looking since running away from the asylums residence adverts your attention away from your surroundings. It wasn’t until I looked down at my feet and saw that I left a trail of bloody footprints after stepping on a body that I realized this. The footprints even faded as the blood was left on the ground. There is an amazing level of detail throughout the levels. Outlast finds the perfect balance of props and design elements so it feels realistic and everything has a reason for it being there. I do commend the game for its level design in that it does not feel like you are constricted to a single path by returning to some areas despite it being completely linear. In my opinion a game is not bad because it is linear, it is bad in the way you can tell the developers made a set sequence of events. After my third playthrough, I do wish I was able to fully explore the entire asylum and make my own adventure because the levels are so damn good. The first time there was a feeling of control I had over each level and had no idea what could've happened next. Many people criticize the parts where you have to flip three levers while playing cat and mouse with an enemy, where I find them as a strength where tension hangs in the air and makes you feel the most vulnerable in a way no jump scare can. I would also like to highlight the games difficulty where I wish the normal difficulty was harder, I do like the choice that there isn't an easy mode which would ruin any level of horror or challenge since if something can't hurt you, its not scary. The insane mode did give me a reason to go back since I did play it for the achievement and enjoyed learning the lore more in depth my next two playthoughs. Without going into detail, the horror aspects are very good, and have succeeded in being creative and heart-pounding. I also would like to point out how good the DLC is, it is even better than the base game and fills in some loose ends while telling the same story at the same time as the base game just from a different perspective. Outlast is an outstanding game in more ways than just the horror.\n\n[b]Rating: 8.6/10[/b]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThePentacidist/]-Penta[/url]",

Outlast is not like any other horror game: it has a good story. It doesn’t repeat the same scenes- it is always different. The characters, oh the terrifying characters, will be the only things you imagine. The graphics for this thrilling game are amazing and makes this game realistic. The game lay is on-point, it isn’t too hard to spot things and if your there (Lillie an idiot) standing, forgetting the controls it will sometimes remind you so you don’t spend 10 minutes seeking for a shitty YouTube tutorial with shitty commentary. I highly recommend this game! But I warn you...if you are scared of people being chased... this game will make your life a living horror.",

      "summary": "Kentucky Route Zero is a magical realist adventure game about a secret highway in the caves beneath Kentucky, and the mysterious folks who travel it. Gameplay is inspired by point-and-click adventure games (like the classic Monkey Island or King's Quest series, or more recently Telltale's Walking Dead series), but focused on characterization, atmosphere and storytelling rather than clever puzzles or challenges of skill. \n \nThe game is developed by Cardboard Computer (Jake Elliott and Tamas Kemenczy). The game's soundtrack features an original electronic score by Ben Babbitt along with a suite of old hymns & bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers.",

This is probably one of the best gaming narratives of the last decade, looks beautiful, and pulls of the rare feat of making your meaningless choices feel profoundly significant. Part Three especially had me almost gasping at every sequence. The story starts as you playing as Conway, a delivery driver trying to make his last delivery, and for most of chapter one this seems like \"just\" a game of backwood weirdness, As the story expands,and you meet and eventually play as more characters, the scope of the story expands untill it becomes an interactive funeral procession for America itself, as well as (in the best postmodern tradition) an endlessly self reflective rumination on how we interact with games. Highly recommended-cant wait to see how the creators blow me away with the finish.",

              "review": "Was really enjoying this game at first. Like, really, really enjoying this game. I didn't mind the combat and I liked all the rest of it.\n\nThen i unlocked most things and beat the final boss and tried out endless mode even though the RNG was wearing on me already.\n\nI hated it. I fucking hate the RNG in this game. You can be doing so well then all of a sudden the game is fucking over. I get it's a rogue like right, but I haven't played a good rogue like that can literally end your run immediately if you're doing well. You can get hampered, you can get close to losing, but this game can just END it. Immediatley. No chance of saving it.\n\nThe shell game aspect is okay sometimes. If it moves at normal speeds and doesn't shuffle itself more than 2 times you can usually get the card you want. But sometimes it just moves super fast and you have a flat 25% chance to get anything because it is 100% shuffled. Has ruined alot of games for me.\n\nThen the combat finally started wearing on me. You press a button to block and a button to swing your weapon. That's pretty much it if you don't have an ability or an artifact. I would press a button to block a projectile then I'd get hit by an unlblockable attack, yes they can come out very quickly and give you no time to respond, which in turn would let me get hit by the projectile, which would in turn let me get hit by some other asshole. I find most games that can let you get juggled by AI, especially when there's such a large amount sometimes, to be absolutely unplayable. It's not fun. I don't watch other people play games and I sure as hell don't want to watch the AI play a fucking game with my body.\n\nI want to mention there is no way to view the board if you get a card that reveals the whole thing. You get to see it for a brief moment but after you comfirm that, you can't scroll through the cards on the board or anything. Really fucking agitating. Let me see the board, I spent a wholel turn unlocking it.\n\nThe dude says the same thing over and over again. Kind of annoying. Also at times you'll be trying to read some card description but he has a long winded speach and you're not sure if you need to listen to him or read the card so you end up doing neither. Or you just listen to him and it feels like a waste of time.\n\nLastly, there's bugs. Some times while looking at multiple cards there is no highlight so you don't know which card you have selected, you can guess usually but not all the time. Sometimes the main deck will get shuffled away but will end up being back in the middle of the board, blocking cards. The combat feels like one whole big bug too.\n\n\nLike I said, I enjoyed it at first, but then it all just started wearing me down. The flaws caught up and just surpassed any enjoyment I got out of this game. Now it is pure frustration and anger at RNGesus hating me. I guess give it a shot if you are interested in this genre and think you are luck reincarnate.",

However, it was not the case since the new cards that are continuously earned keeps the game interesting and not really repetitive.\n\nActually, the only issue I had with the game was the final boss who is ridiculously overpowered. The game gets more and more difficult but is manageable, however this final boss... it's just a lot of frustration especially since there is no \"ending\".\n\nIn any case, I still had a lot of fun and really recommend this game.",

A test of a true mastermind will be to execute the plan to perfection, keep the goons alive, and walk away with the maximum loot from each heist.<br><br>Depending on your preference, you can hit your targets loud, or in stealth, or a mix of both. Keep the civilians under control, knock them out, or leave no witnesses. It's all up to you, just make sure you won't be there when the cops arrive - or be ready for a brutal firefight.<br><br>If you are hungry for more content on top of the campaign, you can test your mettle in the 8 challenge maps, built by the development team, available through Steam Workshop.

It really is a test of effective communication for both players, the defuser (the player on the computer describing the bomb) & the \"expert\" (the player searching the bomb defusal manual for directions to defuse the bomb) . It seems to be intended as a party game , but you could potentially play with someone over the internet using something like discord or skype.\nI also like that it is a way to play a game with my girlfriend without her having to also buy it since her laptop runs so few games. \nIt can get so stressfull watching the timer count down, while your team mate is franticly searching the manual for which button to press or wire to cut. On several puzzles there are a lot of chances for misunderstandings or mishaps because either player gets flustered. There are other distractions that occur in game like the lights turning off in the room or the alarm clock on the table going off to try and distract you and waste precious time. When you defuse the bomb with only milliseconds left it feels so good though!\nThe bomb defusal manual comes as a PDF and you can use it that way, but I really recommend printing it out and putting it in a binder.\nIt is also available in a native Linux version now as well, which runs flawless for me.\n",

              "review": "Keep talking and Nobody explodes is a game for 2 or more players, in which you have two roles to play. One looks at the screen. He is in a room with a bomb with several 'modules' (see them as micro puzzles) that need to be completed in order to defusse it. There is one small catch though. The instructions in doing so are given to the player(s) that cannot see the bomb. WIth quick communication and the occasional scream and explosion you try to solve all the bombs.\n\nThe game is easy to pick up and the controlls are simple, making it good for parties, as even non-gamers won't have any trouble figuring out the controls. A great thing about it, is you only need one copy to be able to play this, and is completly offline (you have to have the manual printed though, but just viewing it on your phone works well enough). While the game is perhaps a bit expensive (ish) for the hours you get out of it, it offers fun for multiple people at the same time, so you could doubble or tripple that number.\n\nIn terms of gameplay-it's great. Graphics aren't amazing, but are good for low-end devices and graphics don't matter in general. Controlls are simple, and the ''campain'' levels are well structered (easy to hard). They are also randomized every time you play them (they have some requirements like they have to have a certain module, and they have a fixed amount of them), making it fun for people that have played in already and are teaching newbies. It also offers a high score, so you can have some competition in it.\n\nBesides the main campain the game also offers a randomizer, where you can pick a number of modules, time etc. and just start playing an infinite amount of generated bombs, making the replay value really good. The steam workshop offers a few mods for extra modules and maps, just in case you got bored.\n\nThe only real negative thing about this game that it does require a game or two to fully understand, especially the manual is a bit of a struggle to understand when first playing it. So keep in mind you will need at least 10-15 min to really start playing, as some explaining is required in order to have fun.\n\nFInaly I should mention it has VR support, and while I don't have VR, this game seems to be the perfect macht with it.\n\nPros\n+Great concept, lots of fun\n+Awesome party game, even for non-gamers\n+Easy to play, hard to master\n+Requires only one, not very good PC\n+VR support\n+Great replay value, with workshop and randomizer\n\nCons:\n-Price might be a little too high if you are only planning on playing this for a few times\n-Does require a few games to really get into it, so not really good for very short sessions\n-Cannot be played alone (well if you really want to, but this is a partygame)\n\nOverall a great game, must have for anyone, even non-gamers.\n8.5/10",

Help Manny untangle himself from a conspiracy that threatens his very salvation. \n \nOne of the most acclaimed adventure games of all time is now back, better than ever. Grim Fandango's epic story of four years in the life (or death) of Manny Calavera, travel agent to the dead, has been remastered to look, sound, and control even better than when it won GameSpot's Game of the Year award upon its original launch. Grim Fandango still stands as a classic of the genre, with unforgettable characters and unique combination of film noir and Mexican folklore.",

I keep hearing a lot of people say this game is good, in aspects of its aesthetics, its story, its puzzles, and a lot more to be praised upon. Didn’t think much about it, since i thought this game was overrated. But whoowe, it was wrong of them to ever doubt it.\n\nThis game is so damn good. I like it very much. It is aesthetically pleasing as a lot of people have mentioned. The story was interesting and was never ever boring to me, ever. The puzzles were quite tricky though ( maybe it’s just me cause I’m kinda new to this type of genre of games or just too slow to figure them out, might be both), but they weren’t such a headache to figure it out (or just look up a guide). The characters? Oh, i love Manny and Glottis so much. They’re just the best. Great  voice acting as well, really. And i love the small details they made to make this game enjoyable and funny, especially the dialogues and achievements.\n\nAs for the cons, i wouldn’t really say it’s that many. Just glitches. Only happened once when i was playing my game and it was hilarious. Nothing much about this game’s cons.\n\nWould recommend highly. It has certainly opened my eyes towards these types of games. Try something different once in a while. If you are, this game is a must.",

              "review": "Very good remaster, stayed true to the original concept. It is a game resurrected from the golden age of Lucas Arts games. I am looking forward to play more remastered hidden treasures like this one.\n\nAbout the game itself: A really unique and funny take on the afterlife, set in a day of the dead/mexican/mayan/aztec noir theme. It has a lots of references and easter eggs to be found. Simple but sometimes challenging game, which was common in that gaming era. As you progress you are presented with a slightely harder puzzles and scenarios. But it is very rewarding when you finnally piece together the puzzles. \nLoved the music, especially that they composed big band and jazzy sounds too. The music and sounds perfectly captures what the visuals estabilish.\nThe controls are pretty solid and clean. I played it with a controller and it is good with it too. They ported it really well.\nI haven't finished it yet, but I feel that it is a game that deserves to be played from time to time. \n\nOnly negative is that sometimes there are places in the game where the controls can be a little bit jammy when there are a lot of things in a realitvely small scene, but not a big deal. This doesn't ruin the gaming experience.\n\nOverall it is a fun and very nostlagic game too. Thanks for the revival, and consider digging up more gems like this.",

              "review": "Grim Fandango is a game that, at the peak of the era of classic adventure games, stood as a high mark of the genre. It is one of the best and most beloved Lucasarts titles, as well as one of the last adventure games the company developed. Grim Fandango's film noir story, reminiscent in tone to noire classics such as The Maltese Falcon, is peppered with dark humor and superbly written. Combined with the game's aztec and art deco inspired visual design, and latin and jazz influenced musical score, it created a truly unique and exceptional atmosphere compared to other adventure titles of the 90's.\n\nPROS\n+ Wonderful and unique atmosphere and visual design\n+ Dark, film noir narrative, often heartfelt, with plenty of witty and charming humor\n+ Good length for an adventure game, and satisfying to play to its conclusion\n+ Superb writing, dialogue and narrative still hold up for the most part, marred by a couple cringy lines\n+ Excellent voice acting\n+ Soundtrack is one of the best in the adventure genre. Evocative and beautiful, it perfectly fits the atmosphere and has been totally remastered using a live orchestra\n+ Improved controls - use a mouse, controller, or the original keyboard only tank controls (there is even an achievement for playing through it the way it was originally designed)\n+ Runs well on PC, as it should, did not encounter any bugs\n+ Improved aspect ratio, now able to choose 16:9 stretched, or the original 4:3\n+ Higher resolution character and 3d models\n+ Improved real-time lighting and shadows\n+ Enhanced cutscenes, movies look good considering the age of this game\n+ Developer commentary added, can be funny at times\n+ Achievements added\n\nCONS:\n- Prerendered backgrounds are unfortunately not remastered, look no different to the original\n- Dialogue has not been enhanced or improved, and some static can be heard in a few lines\n- Ability to switch between original and remastered mode is nothing but a curiosity, redundant, and not worth playing the game that way\n- Outdated and often illogical puzzle design\n- The archaic gameplay may be frustrating to some\n\nGrim Fandango Remastered can not, if we are being honest with ourselves, be called a complete remaster. Had the backgrounds been completely redone, or the dialogue cleaned up in a few places, this would be a different story. As it is, the remaster feels more like a touch-up of a beloved classic, albeit a damn good one. It stays faithful to the original - the humor still works, the strength of the original voice acting still shines, the game is still steeped in that lovely film noir atmosphere and is a blast to replay for someone who grew up in that golden age, the 90's. Despite the few flaws this remaster has, it is still the best way to experience the high point of a gaming era which has, sadly, long gone by. Get it on sale, or for full price if you're an old school fan, worth it for the nostalgia alone.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 8/10",

      "summary": "Jazzpunk is a single-player, first-person adventure game, focusing on exploration and comedy over puzzle-solving. Each mission has one central objective, but the player is free to explore the game world at their own pace, which is populated with a large number of interactive NPCs, each with their own action or gag. Mini-games, including mini-golf, a Frogger clone, and a version of Duck Hunt in which the player pelts cardboard ducks with slices of bread from a toaster, also feature prominently in the game's storyline.",
      "storyline": "The game is centered around a top-secret espionage agency operating out of an abandoned subway station in late 1950's Japan. The player takes the role of Polyblank, a silent protagonist. The game begins when Polyblank is mailed to the espionage agency in a human-shaped suitcase. He is then given several missions by the head of the organization, all of which begin by ingesting a dose of prescription medicine and which end with the protagonist sitting on a bench in a Zen garden, feeding breadcrumbs to Koi fish. The missions assigned to Polyblank are almost always bizarre and nonsensical, relying heavily on free association and references to older movies and video games. Tasks include degaussing and smuggling pigeons, assassinating cowboys, cross-dressing, killing a pig with a six-string guitar, and photocopying Polyblank's bottom to fool a security scanner.\nThe first mission begins with Polyblank having to infiltrate a Soviet consulate to recover a data cartridge, the second to go to a sushi restaurant to steal a cowboy's artificial kidney. On the way back from the sushi restaurant, Polyblank is intercepted by agents telling him to 'hand over the wetware', but he escapes. The Director then states that Polyblank should take a holiday while they wait for things to die down. When Polyblank gets to Kai Tak Resort for his holiday, he receives a phone call telling him he has to find the syndicate man (The Editor) on site and switch briefcases with him. Polyblank succeeds, but then passes out after drinking a cocktail. Polyblank wakes up in a hotel room at night with a message telling him to come to the rear pool. In the empty rear pool, Polyblank talks to a man who tells him the resort is a simulation, and to get out he must find, kill and cook the mechanical pig. After doing this, and navigating an electric maze, Polyblank finds himself back in the subway station, only to find the Director and his secretary are cardboard cutouts. He then finds an audio message from the Editor telling him if he wants to see them again he should come to his house. Polyblank goes there, and he is told he must beat the Editor in a game of sport for the Director to be freed. Polyblank loses, and so must find prizes for the Editor. Polyblank does this, inflating the Editor's ego, then he pops the Editor with a needle. Polyblank then finds the Director, where to free him he must either press a button. No matter which Polyblank presses, the Director turns into a crocodile and eats Polyblank. The credits take place in the Director's intestines, and then Polyblank is giving special tablets to help him get out. The game ends after Polyblank takes the pills.",

Every gaming session is different as large parts are randomly generated. \n \nBlast your way through walls with guns and cybernetic abilities and try alternate approaches with different roles like the Hacker or the Cyber Psycho. Upgrade your character stats, discover new cybernetic enhancements and build up strength to finally stop the Overseer. Every death is a new beginning – the path to stopping the Overseer is never the same.",

              "review": "If you're looking for a game review than you came to the wrong place, now if you wanted a delicious pancake recipe...\n\n\n\nIngredients + Equipment\n\nYou’ll need a mixing bowl, a wire whisk, a spatula and a non-stick griddle or skillet. An electric griddle works wonders too, if you make a lot of pancakes at your house. The ingredients you’ll need are:\n\n1 ¼ cup milk \n2 eggs \n2 tablespoons vegetable oil \n2 cups all-purpose flour \n2 tablespoons sugar \n3 teaspoons baking powder \n¼ teaspoon salt\n\nThe Batter\nPancakes aren’t complicated, so the batter is everything! For best results, mix that bowl of batter up right before it’s going to hit the griddle.\n\nThe wet ingredients come together first. Beat the milk, eggs and vegetable oil in a mixing bowl with a wire whisk.\n\nThe dry ingredients—flour, baking powder, sugar and salt—are then stirred into the wet mixture. Baking powder is what makes the pancakes fluffy, while the sugar helps the exterior caramelize just enough. And a dash of our friend salt enhances the flavor.\n\nGently mix everything together until it’s combined, but still lumpy. It’ll only take about 10-15 seconds to get to that liquidy-lumpy state. If you over-mix the batter, you’re going to be chowing down on a very tough, rubbery pancake because the gluten molecules start having a party. If you under-mix, you might end up with a mouthful of flour.\n\n\nThe Cooking\nBrush a non-stick griddle or skillet with vegetable oil, clarified butter or cooking spray before heating. You don’t need too much with a nonstick pan. (You may be tempted to use regular butter, but it tends to burn easily. Save the butter for the breakfast table.)\n\nHeat the griddle over medium-high heat. To determine when the griddle is ready for pancake action, run your hand under the faucet and carefully flick just a tiny bit of water onto the surface of the pan. The water droplets will bead up and sizzle when it’s ready.\n\nPour ¼ cup of batter onto the hot griddle and cook 1-2 minutes or until the bubbles on the surface have finished popping and the pancake is dry around the edges.\n\nNow it’s time to flip. Using a spatula, gently turn the pancake over and cook on the other side until golden brown.\n\n\nServe warm\nFluffy Pancakes\nPrint Recipe\n(0) 0 View Full Recipe\nIngredients\nSteps\nHow to Keep Pancakes Hot\nIf you’re cooking for a crowd, turn the oven to 325°F and put your finished pancakes on a baking sheet as they come off the griddle. That way they all stay hot until you are ready to eat.\n\nHow to Store Leftover Pancakes in the Freezer\nStack cooled pancakes between a sheet of waxed paper or parchment. Wrap the stack in foil and freeze. To reheat, preheat the oven to 400°F. Unwrap frozen pancakes and remove from waxed paper. Heat pancakes in a single layer on an ungreased cookie sheet for 5 to 7 minutes or until heated through.\n\nHow to Store Leftover Batter\nStoring leftover batter is one of those things one could technically do, but should one? Nah, one really shouldn’t.\n\nThe baking powder loses its oomph very quickly and the gluten molecules have a field day of chewiness when they are allowed to sit around. Rather than storing leftover batter, we recommend making just the right amount of batter for your breakfast or cooking up the whole batch and storing leftover pancakes in the freezer as directed above.\n\nBack To Top\nTwists on Pancakes\nPancakes are meant to be twisted! There are so many ways you can upgrade your pancakes, from batter mix-ins to mid-griddle additions to final toppings.\n\nBatter mix-ins might include pureed pumpkin with pumpkin pie spice, lemon zest and ricotta cheese or even mashed bananas. Our Gingerbread Pancakes are perfect for the holidays. Buttermilk is a common substitute for milk in pancakes too, as the acidity provides extra volume, browning and flavor. Adding additional (or different) wet ingredients may mean you need to adjust your dry ingredients accordingly, so unless you’re simply shaking a bit of cinnamon into your batter, you’ll want to follow a recipe to make sure your flavored pancakes turn out perfectly.\n\nMid-griddle additions would include those tasty bits that you’ll want to place on your hot cakes before you flip them—things like whole berries, chocolate chips, crunchy granola or little pieces of bacon. Adding these types of things to the individual pancakes rather than the batter helps them stay evenly distributed and keeps them from burning. You can use the same Fluffy Pancake recipe outlined above and easily personalize it with whatever you like without changing the batter.\n\nTopping options are pretty much unlimited when it comes to pancakes, and also don’t require any new recipe. Obviously butter and maple syrup are classic pancake pairings for a reason—there is no substitute for a hefty drizzle of real maple syrup. But it’s also wonderful to think outside the syrup container and try topping your pancakes with jam, caramel, nuts, fruit, whipped cream, sprinkles and more!\n\n8 Easy Twists on Pancakes\n\nGingerbread Pancakes\nGingerbread Pancakes\n\nBlueberry Sour Cream Pancakes\nBl",

This needs to be faster, have better graphics, easier to navigate the UI, and you should be able to download planes through the workshop.\n\nJust get Besiege it is so much better. The controls are much easier to navigate and the game is easily modded if you want to make hardcore planes. Besiege does so much more anyways and it has LEVELS, something this game needs. I'm saying levels with puzzles and stuff (like in Besiege), yes you can battle AI but that can be done in any other game. Seriously this doesn't even have multiplayer. Any good builder has multiplayer.",

      "summary": "After a deadly circus fire shatters his world and tarnishes his name, Dropsy the Clown finds himself on a journey of self-discovery through a story that harnesses powerful themes of love and kindness. With his father gravely ill and the world turning its back on a once happy-go-lucky clown, Dropsy will need to help those in need, hug total strangers, and unravel dark and shameful secrets from his past on the way to redemption. Oh, and Dropsy can also talk to animals.\n\nDropsy is a non-traditional take on the classic point and click adventure formula starring the game’s perpetually carefree namesake clown as he explores a richly detailed world full of colorful characters and sinister secrets, doling out hugs along the way. Rather than lead players on a singular narrative path, players are free to choose which avenues of adventure they want to explore in an open world setting and can piece the puzzles and story together however they choose.",

              "review": "Dropsy, to me, is a special game, because it is incredibly wholesome. \n\nIn a lot of video games, the relationship between the player character and the world's characters is coloured by some sort of profit goal. Most interactions are connected to a thought of \"Oh, I wonder what I will get in return\" which usually ends with material rewards or favors that remain 'useful' for further objectives in the game. In point n click adventure games there is also a recurring sadistic (and slightly dehumanizing) type of interaction with characters that provide an obstacle for the player character. Guybrush incarcerates a salesman in a coffin (Monkey Island 2), Drew rigs a gymnast's equipment (Toonstruck) and Rufus tranquilizes his ex-girlfriend (Deponia). \n\nDropsy is different in that it respects the shared humanity between its protagonist and surrounding characters, aswell as turning the player character's relationships from instruments to reach an objective to the central objective of the game.\nDropsy, as a character, might at first glance seem very naive and maybe even stupid (Who hugs trees, right?), but what turns out to be their central quality is being empathetic in a world that seems to be void of it. At the start of the game most characters seem disconnected from each other, absorbed in their own problems. It is Dropsy - an empathic individual, first regarded with rejection, condemnation and fear - that helps them overcome or cope with their problems to start connecting the world again. The Clown's objective is as much a task of finding acceptance and friendship, as a genuine interest in bringing happiness to the saddened lives of others. It is the latter that made this game so refreshing and wholesome to me.\n\nNow, there are other elements to it. There's intriguing mystery, a striking soundtrack and certainly also a few narrative flaws---but what I would say makes this game so special is how it values its relationships. It creates this really wholesome game experience that I would like to see games to explore further and more often.",

The puzzles are challenging but doable, and the world is just large enough for you to lose yourself in it without it being overwhelming.  At the start you can roam a good chunk of the island straight away, with additional areas unlocking as you progress. You gradually gather 3 furry friends which allow you access to places the main character can't go. There is no dialogue, everyone communicates with emotes, which by and large are clear and easy to understand. The art is very cartoony with a surrealist undercurrent, but is all very well done. The soundtrack is fantastic too. As you progress you solve problems for people which makes them happy, enabling you to hug them, making Dropsy one of the most heartstring-tugging games around. Can't recommend enough!",

Who knows but Dropsy is going to try.\n\nNow for what I liked, first off I liked the story and how it could go from heartwarming and sweet to vary creepy and disturbing to a hollowing sadness sometimes.\n\nLiked the fact that this is a complete Text Free Experience, it’s very hard to do but these guys did it, with the characters through an innovative use of visual icons rather than traditional text-based dialog trees. And even without the dialog trees the characters say enough without saying anything.\n\nThe music was very good too, from the gentle electric piano and saxophone melodies, to the space echo drenched dub regga.\n\nThe pixel graphics/art style really good, and like I have said before games like this prove you don’t need super realistic graphics to make a great game.\n\nI all so liked how could hug all most anything it sounds super creepy but this pulls it with warmth a heart and little bit of funny too.\n\nNow for what I did not like, really there is nothing but well some of the Achievements can be a bit of a pain like the What Does It Say About His Clown Level!? Achievement, but that’s really all that’s bad about this game.\n\nSo all in all Dropsy is one of games that is going to be a classic and I so recommend this game. So if you want a cute heartwarming and a good bit creepy this game is for you.\n",

It's really neat, and I think it's really accurate with how I felt back then, when I was that young. \n\nThe music is also beautiful, and it slowly gets darker as more and more are revealed about Kimmy, the main character, and her family. \n\nLastly, even though the animation is very simple it's very pleasant, and I really like all the artwork! \n\nIt's really sad, but worth the money, especially if it's on sale!",

It does a really great job displaying childrens' emotions, dialouges, and thought processes. In my first playthrough alone the story dealt with themes of honesty, bullying, racism, childhood romance, growing up, and nostalgic summers. The story makes you feel like a kid again, especially reminiscent of adults purposefully keeping secrets in fear of you not being able to emotionally comprehend difficult situations. Pick it up if you're a fan of visual novels!",

              "review": "The latest game from designer Nina Freeman (Cibele, Tacoma), Kimmy is a visual novel with a quirky style courtesy of artist Laura Knetzger (who had also worked with Nina on Freshman Year). The game is very simple to play, with the player primarily making a few choices through dialogue and who to interact with. You play as Dana, who becomes a babysitter to younger girl Kimmy. During the days that you babysit, you have a limited amount of time to play with other kids, buy toys and games, and learn more about the residents of your town. As with many of Nina Freeman’s games, what appears on the surface to be a normal 1960’s summer is in fact a dark, mature tale of the struggles that many families face. The game moves along at a good pace, taking you from interaction to interaction without much fuss and hardly a single wasted word throughout the entire game. It is very interesting to see the world through the eyes of a young girl at that time – I can’t think of any other game where the player takes the role of a middle-school-aged-girl. \n\tOverall, it is a very interesting and impactful game that doesn’t take too long to tell its story. If you are a big fan of story in games, or just find this premise interesting, I’d definitely recommend picking Kimmy up! There is a demo on Steam, and the game is available on PC and Mac.",

              "review": "Legend of Grimrock 2 is an old school tile-based dungeon crawler that innovates and improves on old design.\n\nThe Good:\n+Fantastic level design which is an equal mix of puzzles, secrets, and combat.\n+Lots of starting options for characters and classes.\n+Lengthy campaign and big mod community.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Music is decent, but it gets repetitive and there are way too few sound effects.\n-UI is clunky and sifting through for inventories for potions is too much, a hotbar would solve this.\n-Save often, the devs are downright cruel and will spawn deadly enemies way above your level.\n\nBottom Line:\nLegend of Grimrock 2 is a niche title that does an old genre proud, but it is not for everyone. I recommend playing with a walkthrough nearby so you don't get stuck on puzzles for too long, as this can easily break the pacing.",

      "summary": "Satellite Reign is a real-time, class-based strategy game. You control a team of four agents, each with distinct and unique abilities, collectively battling for control of a simulated, living cyberpunk city. \n \nCustomise your team with the strength to destroy your enemies head-on, or hack into their facilities to manipulate their infrastructure without them ever knowing you were even there. \n \nWill you take down your enemies with brute-force? Covert espionage and infiltration? Or will you use propaganda to influence the citizens of the city and overthrow the controlling powers? \n \nThe world's governments are controlled by mega-corporations, democracy to the highest bidder. Society is structured for the benefit of those in power. The poor exist in the dark squalid underbelly of the city, while the wealthy swim in opulence and luxury on the upper tiers, and the vast middle-class are too comfortable with their lives of convenience to see the world for what it really is. Corporate police patrol the streets, brutally maintaining the status quo, all under the guise of keeping the people safe. The time for change is now, as a mysterious organisation rises from the slums of the city. They'll have to bribe, steal, hack, kill and augment their way through the barriers between them and their ultimate goal...but what are they trying to achieve? To free the masses from the corporate stranglehold, or to take control for themselves? That, is up to you.",
      "storyline": "Satellite Reign takes place in an unnamed fictional city referred as \"The City\" where a corporation named Dracogenics rises after releasing a prototype for Immortality named Resurrection-Tech however Dracogenics turns to Corporate crime and bribes politicians with Immortality for control and influence eventually leading to the privatisation of The City's services and full corporate control over The City's Police Force. Civil unrest arises and is suppressed by Dracogenics but a rival corporation soon comes to light and launches anti Dracogenics attacks. The Player controls this Rival Corporation and must overthrow Dracogenics from The City.",

It's alot closer to Company of heroes with 4 units. you just go around, you click on a thing, a timer goes down, you captured the thing. You click on an enemy, a health bar goes down until one of you wins. Unless you do the special move that kills them in one hit. You capture an ATM, you get money over time. It's exactly like company of heroes.\n\nAlso the game has a chronic problem with telling you what's going on. It's an open world sandbox sort-of situation but sometimes the cameras just go alert to you for no reason, sometimes the enemies do. It's not really explained why they do that. What they do tell you is the tutorial. Over and over. Because it's bugged.\n\nIt looks nice but the animations don't. You've got the Command and Conquer 3 style animation where everything just does a running motion and floats to a location.",

It talks about hijacking clones to get stat boosts but you die so often (they degrade on death) its pointless.   Ultimately if you want to play a combat game, you have to download cheats. the bad guys can spawn an infinite number of men with infinite ammo (you don't have infinite ammo).   It sucks, but I don't want to play stealth, so I have to cheat... Thumbs down simply because of that.",

The tutorial teach you to click all over the menus (an absolute mess with nice colors). The story seems really cliche but the atmosphere is good.\nThe game is so slow (not in terms of FPS).\n\nJust fucking hate it, and I don't know why I keep coming back once a year to try it out again and again.

      "summary": "Broforce is an action platformer for PC about 80’s & 90’s action heroes making up the Broforce team, an under-funded vigilante paramilitary organization. The game features ridiculous violence, pixel art graphics and a fully destructible Vietnam setting. While masquerading as a run ‘n gun in the vein of Metal Slug, Broforce’s reactive environment encourages tactical play. Each bro out of the 13 the game currently features has distinctive overpowered attacks and special abilities, and mastering them all is one of Broforce’s core pleasures. Death is instant and can be surprising, but this is balanced by the incompetence of the enemy. Explosions are plentiful and very often result in chaotic chain reactions, but this shouldn’t discourage you from permanently holding down your trigger finger. Yelling “‘Murica!” while you do so is optional. \nBroforce is best played co-operatively, two to four players (though single player is an option). It can be played both on keyboard and on XBox controllers. \nVehicular action sequences, dinosaurs, aliens and epic Contra-inspired boss fights, deathmatch arenas with leaderboards and rankings, a level editor, the ability to challenge friends and share custom levels, a customizable Brofort with unlockable rooms and much more to come in the full game. The only thing left to say is: brace your loins.",

      "summary": "In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. \n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. \n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.",

I can thoroughly say I enjoy the whole survival aspect of this game and the sketchy art that really emphasizes the darkness the scenarios can represent. There's sympathy and moral aspects that you have to put into consideration with thinking before acting. Sometimes you have to let people die that you don't want to and sometimes there's unjustified killings in the eyes of your group. It's a cruel war only made worse by unforgiving thugs and scavengers like you looking to survive another day no matter the consequences. \nIt's This War of Mine that we all burden on our shoulders and forces you to make decisions for the sake of your group and overall survival until the very bitter end. In war, some choose to show the best sides of themselves. Others... the worst.",

Except you don't play as a soldier, there's no cool guns, there's no heroic sacrifices, no military objectives.\nInstead you play as civilians who are trapped in the midst of war, who have no shelter, barely enough food and water to survive. You have to look for supplies, and your people are in depression only tobacco and alcohol can fulfill. That, or death, be it being killed off or suicide.\nThis game manipulates with your emotions in a way hardly any other games can. Sure, you can scavenge empty houses, shops to find supplies. But when they run out, you're left with places with people. Civilians, just like your own, just trying to survive. Can you justify the moral right to rob them of what little glimmer of hope they have left? Their lifeline, being food, water and supplies. Or would you let your own people die, for the sake of others?\nThis is easily a game I can highly recommend to anyone. Its solemn atmosphere really contributes to the overall seriousness and underlying message: War benefits, no one.",

Everywhere is dangerous but you gotta get food, also people will come to your house...some are good but......some of them want your sandwiches, and they will kill you for them.

I found Spacecom even more exciting and involving than most triple-A games recently. I would highly recommend it to all people who like good games.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"http://de.ign.com/spacecom-pc/95403/review/review-zu-spacecom-strategie-kann-so-einfach-sein\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >IGN Deutschland</a><br><br>“Spacecom is simple, both graphically and mechanically—so simple it could almost be a board game.  And yet despite—or rather, because of—this unassuming exterior, there's a lot of depth for you to explore within a limited space. That's the kind of strategy I like! It's like playing an actual game of chess where each piece has a very defined set of rules versus a weird game of pseudo-chess where each pawn functions slightly differently and you won't really understand the point of half of them until you're fifty hours in.  We like to say &quot;Graphics don't matter! Graphics don't matter!&quot; Well, here's your proof. Just bring your imagination to the table, and there's a deeply satisfying strategy game waiting for you.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2684902/spacecom-review-a-rousing-game-of-strategy-between-a-bunch-of-triangles.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PC World</a><br><br>“Spacecom is exactly what I like.

It wasn't bad, but not great either\n\nBossfights were really boring, basicly every boss in story-mode I killed on 1st or 2nd attempt, except for Odyn he took me 4 attempts..\n\nGoing through levels was more tedious than fun. Some levels were waaaay too long for how little there was, If I wanted walking simulator I would play Firewatch... I get it, you only have normal and heavy attack + roll, but jeeeez you could at least put some interesting enemies and not something you kill in 1 normal hit, or 1 heavy hit where the enemy just stands there and take it...\n\nIf you want to know some really little information about Norse mythology, yeah sure.... get the game... OR... you can just go to wiki and read an article in 10 minutes instead of wasting 3-4 hours",

I haven't played that much, and I doubt I'll play a lot more. Besides the comic-book styling there's little to recommend it. You wander around, usually there's some kind of avoidance trick: vines, wind, sea monsters. Then there's checkpoints, places to get power ups, and bosses. That's about it. For an adventure exploration game there's very little sense of discovery. The fights are repetitive, the puzzles are annoying. I found myself accidentally throwing away my power-ups all the time, which are the only way to beat the big bosses. \nSpeaking of the big bosses, the scale is kinda cool, the bosses are HUGE compared to your character, but when you fight them you become a tiny blob on the screen. Caveat, I'm couch playing this game, so that probably contributes to the small-blobiness of the character. \nI guess one more positive is the voice acting. I do like the old Norse, or fake Norse that's read at various intervals. \nI'd give this a 2 out of 5 stars.",

I believe they need to rework the controls they can keep the reloading of some characters but they need to make the game twin stick with all characters because the rest don't work well they need to rework Pablo and a few other characters. I would not buy this game unless you can get it at a huge discount or they rework they controls\nTl:dr intresting concept classic feel but bad controls",

      "summary": "Kero Blaster is a platform video game created by Daisuke \"Pixel\" Amaya. It was released in 2014 for PC and iOS and is the first major project of Pixel since Cave Story in 2004. The game lays a heavy emphasis on shooting and got positive reviews on both platforms. A short, free demo titled Pink Hour has been available since a month before the full game's release.\nIn Kero Blaster, the player controls a frog working for Cat & Frog, a teleporter company. Armed with a peashooter, he has to clean the teleporters of strange black monsters. The player has to work their way through a series of linear stages, by means of running, gunning and jumping. USGamer described the gameplay as \"akin to ... Contra or old-school, pre-Symphony of the Night Castlevanias.\" Furthermore, the game is controlled by changing direction, jumping, firing your weapon and changing your weapon. Holding down the fire button continues to fire in the direction you were facing when you started shooting.",

      "summary": "Dungeon Siege III (DSIII or DS3) is an action role-playing game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows.[5] Chris Taylor, the original creator of Dungeon Siege, served as an advisor during the development of the game. It is the third game in the series not to be developed by Gas Powered Games, (after Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna by Mad Doc Software and Dungeon Siege: Throne of Agony by SuperVillain Studios) and the first to be published by Square Enix after it acquired the complete ownership of the Dungeon Siege franchise. It was released on June 17, 2011. (wiki, 2014)",
      "storyline": "The game returns to the Kingdom of Ehb, which already featured as the setting of the first (but not second) game. Roughly 150 years after the events of Dungeon Siege, the 10th Legion, who provided stability and protection for the kingdom for 400 years, has almost completely been wiped out. 30 years before the game's setting, Jeyne Kassynder rallied the people of eastern Ehb and the Azunite Church against the Legion who she blamed for the death of the king (her father). Following a long and brutal campaign, she managed to kill the entire remnant of the Legion in a battle in the Rukkenvahl Forest and the royalist army of young Queen Roslyn has been driven deep into the mines of Glitterdelve, losing almost all of their power.

Players complete quests and use swords, ranged weapons, and magic spells to kill both human and supernatural enemies (e.g., skeletons, goblins, demons, giant wolves). Battles include hack-and-slash combat, highlighted by cries of pain and brief puffs of blood. During the course of the game, players can elect to spare or kill certain boss characters; if players choose the latter, the boss is depicted in a small pool of blood. Some female characters are depicted in the game wearing low-cut outfits that reveal moderate amounts of cleavage; the dialogue also contains some suggestive references (e.g., 'Your mother seduced Montbarron?' and 'We will seduce a foreign man, but only if he is strong . . . clever . . . handsome.'). The words 'whore,' 'damn,' and 'bastard' can be heard in dialogue.",

              "review": "If you are thinking of buying this hoping it would be a modern version of Dungeon Siege 1 or 2, please do not.  It is virtually NOTHING like the first 2 in the series and almost every aspect of the game is miserable.  The camera angles(2) are both absolutely terrible.  The controls feel like you are trying to use a console controller on a game that was designed for mouse and keyboard... even when using a mouse and keyboard.  The \"stats\" have little to know clear meaning or explaination... that being said it's impossible to know what gear is better.  The maps are VERY linear, magnified by the minimap which is basically a straight line that you follow.  Little to no customization of your characater relative to the previous versions of the game.\n\nLong story short, do NOT buy this game, or the 3-game package.",

              "review": "Wow!  What a gem, I purchased this game a few years ago and had wanted to get to it, but hadn't made the time.  Having played the first and second one this one blew it out of the water.  It's not open world, but very flexible in terms of moral and action choices - think Mass Effect + early Fable, at the end you get a great montage of how your actions impacted the future of the game.  It was hard to believe how good the graphics are for a 7 year old game.  Look forward to next edition.\n\nOnly gripes are that they need a better inventory system (selling and identfying what is on whom is rough) and improve on the key mapping descriptions - Key 1 equals power 1 should become Key 1 equals what ever the contextual power you have set the slot too.",

While not being overly detailed or stunningly beautiful, the art design is fitting and especially the writing is an absolute contrast to the brutal game world, as it is absolutely innocent.\n\nWasn't too fond of the ending, but this is definitely one of the majorly interesting adventures released within the last couple of years. Definitely recommend to adventure fans with a knack for morbid themes. Not for the faint of heart or those easily disturbed.",

Despite knowing how this game works and ways to solve puzzles, I looked into a walk-through few times, just to be sure that Fran absolutely definitely won't die (it actually ruined some moments of the game for me, don't do that).\nI was a little disappointed in the end, because, well, I knew that nothing can be perfect in Fran's life anymore, but I still hoped it freaking will, because she is so cool. She was the one in the game, who calmed me down, with her childish and innocent attitude. You know, I see a monster and my instincts are screaming: \"we're DONE, Fran will die because of me\", and then this little girl just says something like: \"hello mr. Monster, how is your day?\" She is the only reason I finished this game. She is super great.",

              "review": "If you like any of the following, you'll enjoy this game: Labyrinth, Alice in Wonderland, Mirrormask, Neverending Story, etc etc.\n\nFran, a young girl, ends up in a twisted mental hospital, following the homicide of her parents. Who killed them and why? Fran is given a mysterious drug that lets her switch between realities and travel to new worlds parallel to ours. She sees weird monsters and imaginary friends. What is real? Is someone trying to kill her?\n\nThe game play is about 8 hours with 5 chapters, and very similar to The Silent Age, another point and click game that lets you switch between realities. The puzzles are not overly difficult but some of them are obtuse, requiring you to randomly click on things until something works.\n\nThere are some stupidly easy platform jumping and maze games, there's no fail state and some you can just skip over.\n\nThere's some very disturbing imagery (a la Hellraiser) and surrealistic horror. Lots of dead children, gore, and bad things happening to people. Not recommended for young children, but there's no sex or cursing. Fran remains optimistic even though really terrible things are happening to her. It falls into the realm of horror fantasy, and it's not all horrible. The middle bit is fantasy, and there's some murder mystery thrown in for good measure.\n\nIt was really fun to play, the art is delightful, and it'll leave you thinking. Highly recommended!",

              "review": "Fran Bow is a great game. The game creators really created an excellent point and click horror game. The switching between worlds works perfectly fine and add some deep to the gameplay. You come accross some very disturbing situation and characters and in an horror game that's a plus. The puzzles and enigmas in the game are challenging but not too much to the point how you end up banging your head in search of a solution. \n\nVery Interresting story developed and you want to know more about Fran and her strange world. \nIn the end some of the force of the game are also it's weakness. As I said the puzzles and enigmas aren't as challenging as some other games and it can be finished quickly (9 hours in my case) and at the end you're still craving for more, more of this disturbing world and mind of the little Fran Bow, more quests and for some maybe some more explenations ( The end is pretty open leaving you with maybe too many interpretations and not answered questions).\n\nIn the end even if the game price can be see as a little high for it's game time play, I still recommend it, and if you ever come across it during a sale and like horror games or disturbing point and click buy it with your eyes close. \n\n+ \nExcellent disturbing atmosphere and characters.\nThe quest and game mechanics are really well made.\nIf you like games with an open ending and everything up to your interpretation, this game ending is for you\nA steal if you come across this game during a sale.\n\n-\nIf you're up for a challenging game you will probably find it too easy.\nSome more hours of play could have been welcome.\nMore answer about what is really happening in Fran mind and world. If you like games with a clear ending and answer to everything you could end up with more questions than answers at the end of it. \nYou can find the price a little to high for all of it's content",

It puts you in control of humanity’s first manned mission to Mars, just as it’s struck by a micrometeoroid storm. You must guide your crew through disasters, food shortages, and the unforgiving nature of space — all while maintaining your sanity amidst cryptic signals and warnings from Mars.\n\nDefy the odds, make the difficult decisions, and embark on the most important mission in human history.",
      "storyline": "A mysterious signal originating from the Tharsis region of Mars set us on a frantic mission. Who sent it? And why? Impossible questions, but in them lie the key to humanity’s survival.\n\nNow, millions of miles away from home, a micrometeoroid storm has left us with a severely damaged ship, two deceased crew, and the sneaking suspicion this trip was doomed from the start.",

It's possible to make it to Mars with all crew alive, but if you think you're going to breeze through this, it's going to be a real short trip for the crew of the Iktomi.\n\nBackstory is 'The Martian' meets 'The Twilight Zone'.  It's bad enough when you *start* the game with low food, a deranged crew, and a ship that's falling apart......but then things just get weirder and weirder the closer you get to Mars.  \n\nSound track is god damn amazing.\n\nLearning curve deeper than it looks.  I suspect a lot of players, myself included, just started out by attempting to fix everything broken/damaged/on fire.  This will just end in tears.  After blowing up the Iktomi a few dozen times, you start to sort out the real strategy and hidden rules.  A couple posters complain about the lack of tutorial; legit beef, but the missions, outside of the 'regular' game, help *a lot* with the strategy and hidden rules.\n\nI was sort of worried about role of dice in the game when figuring out if this was for me.  It seemed shallow, but Choice Provisions really gives you a lot of options with what to do with what you get.  Plan it dead on right, and you'll be mostly OK.  Throw it away and you'll be regretting it real soon.  \n\nStarting out screwed from the word 'go' and still succeeding really makes you feel like a superhero.  Get your ass to Mars!\n",

Now I keep coming back to try new crew members and any new strategies those crew members might add. \n\nI do feel that I should say that I might not have persevered if the game had not had the Easy difficulty setting. I went into the game not expecting to win my first time- or even my first few times- but being able to make it to Round 6, then Round 9 over (and over and over) again let me know that, while I might be failing, I was figuring things out, and getting close. If I'd been soundly knocked out repeatedly very early on I'd have possibly been too discouraged to continue. Instead, when I finally beat the game on Easy, I was able to take a deep breath and, with a better feel for how the game works, move on to Normal. Mayhaps someday I'll transition to Hard? At which point I'll probably descend into space madness resort to the (in game) Cannibalism I've held off of so far...  will have to see!",

              "review": "This is a very decent (short) game. Nice neat presentation and gameplay concept. Ignore people moaning about the chance element, it's a dice game, it is what it is. However there are enough options and tactics available to outweigh the chance element and make for an absorbing and tense little game. Careful choices in astronaut deployment and dice allocation mean even a lousy throw of the dice can be turned to advantage. Lots of little touches like assists, astronaut specialities and research add choice and depth. It will certainly pass several evenings pleasurably for the price of a pint (if you get it on sale). You can take it at a leisurely pace and it's maybe one to play in between bouts with your ongoing favourite long games. Recommended, I'd be interested in more games with a similar concept. Background story is poor/cliched, but who cares?",

              "review": "[b][u]5 Things You Should Know about [i]Tharsis[/i][/u][/b]\n[b]What's Is It?[/b]\nSci-Fi digital board game about a space ship headed to Mars (and managing to collide with just about every piece of space debris between here and there.)  This is a pure board game in a digital format.  There are actually dice that roll and get moved around - using a physics engine to roll 3D cubes, not typical computer RNG.  It's a resource management game with aspects of worker placement and Yahtzee-style set collections, for the board game geeks amongst us.  Overall, it's pretty tense.  They did a good job of balancing incoming threats so that you're always pushing the limit of your capabilities to keep things together.\n\n[b]What's The Best Part?[/b]\nI enjoyed the combination of resource management and worker placement.  You have to manage each crew member's health, stress level and dice, which represent their overall ability.  After rolling the dice, you need to place them in various \"slots.\"  There's a generic \"solve the current crisis\" slot, which has a numeric target value you need to meet with pips rolled.  Then each module has an ability that can be used if you can put the right dice in place (some require a single die of value X+, others require a pair or a triple of any face value.)  You can slough off extra dice into research, which has you slowly building a \"straight\" of dice, 1 - 6, and these can then be \"spent\" to research things that grant benefits.\n\nSometimes rolling a particular value will cause injury, or make the die evaporate, until you solve the current crisis in your module, so you need to focus on crises first most of the time.\n\n[b]What's The Worst Part?[/b]\nI didn't find much to complain about in this one, honestly.  The astronauts' faces seem very low-poly compared to the rest of the graphics in the game, although that may just be a result of the portraits being \"zoomed in\" much closer than the rest of the ship, which we see from a further distance.  It felt incongruous, though.  I think it might've been better to use cel shaded or static 2D art for the portraits.  But this is clearly a nit-pick, the game is still fantastic as-is.\n\n[b]Will I Like It?[/b]\nIf you're NOT into the modern board game hobby scene, you might be somewhat off-put by the board game format they've used.  This game could literally be printed physically and sold as such if they wanted to.  The only change needed would be relatively simple - converting the hazards into a deck of cards to be drawn from, or something like that.)\n\nIf you ARE into the modern board gaming scene, it depends on how you feel about the mechanics involved - resource management, worker placement and Yahtzee.  And co-op, I suppose (I mean, as a physical board game it would be 1 - X co-op - no traitor mechanics.)\n\n[b]Why Should I Buy It?[/b]\nBecause you like the idea of digital board games, or you like board games enough to overlook the digital aspect.\n\nThis has been a 5TYSK review.

Your adventure begins on a blank page, but the world will soon become larger and livelier as you gather inspiration, solve its mysteries and defeat its enemies. From movement to opening chests and fighting in epic battles, every element in the game is controlled exclusively with the keyboard. \n \nAs you progress and explore the fantasy origami world, the story literally unfolds in the writer’s mind and the mysteries of the magic power of the words are revealed.",

The world is built from paper and the creators have used a variety  of methods to showcase their artistic style. \nUnfortunately I found the game's narrative a little - simple, and after a while it just became poetic drivel. Though each chapter (new area) brings a great new game mechanic and visual style, the enemy encounters become quite repetitive and a little uninspired compared to the world they're in. \nI'd recommend this for a short and visually pleasing experience and think the 3-4 hours length is pretty much spot on.",

Actually, that's not true, since I learned on an electric typewriter, rather than a computer keyboard, so 45 wpm was pretty damn good back in the day (that day being 1986). And we guys thought we'd NEVER use typing skills in our lives, ever. Pfft.\n\nWhat sucks is that this game forces me to go back to school, as it were, and relearn the proper way to type, rather than the insane way I normally do things. Having to do the basics all over again is helpful, though, and at least the game makes typing fun.\n\nWell, when I say \"fun\", I mean the kind if you like juggling machetes and playing chicken with bullet trains. This game will stress out most folks, but it's still a blast if you keep at it. Plus, the story isn't half-bad. I have to mute the music, since it annoys me quickly, and the voiceover sounds like a friend of mine who used to stay up for 48 hours straight during finals week. Laconic much? Otherwise, I like it.\n\nE2A--Anybody ever play an old typing game called Typing (or Typer, can't recall exactly) Shark? Same concept, different enemies, less forgiving. In harder levels, my name was Chum.",

From the graphics, to how everything is treated as a story by having paper shift to create the environment, to having all words appear on the environment itself. It's really all lovely. The voice actress is really great, too. There's so much emotion and meaning behind her few words, for which I greatly appreciated.\n\nOne note, though: if you don't like typing games, you wont like this game. Plain and simple.\n\nI enjoy typing games (ex: Typing of the Dead). This game stood out by having the concept of schools of magic. An enemy may need to be killed using fire, for example, or you may want to choose to use electric/spark magic because any hits against an enemy split off and hit a few other enemies nearby. I loved this mechanic different that made this game stand out against others.",

The origami-like environment is beautiful, the music emotional accentuating and the story mysterious and only in fragments told as you progress in the game. At the beginning you have to get used to the mechanics because this game is designed to be played with the keyboard only, but after a while you'll don't even notice this anymore. Just one thing has to be said: If you are not familiar with 10-finger-writing this game will be really hard for you. In the later battles there is no time to look down on the keyboard and back to the display. But if you enjoy writing overall and like indie games then I highly recommend this game for you.",

And I for one loved the animation style.\n\nDetails: This is a simple (not in a bad way!), but exquistely animated game. In some ways it reminds me of those \"games\" we played in school to teach us how to touch-type, but this is actually entertaining. There are puzzles and four different 'typing weapons'  you can use that have different effects on so-called 'monsters' (burn/freeze/shock/blow away the bug creatures). The game also has different modes--it will scale with how fast you can type if you want it to.\n",

              "review": "Epistory Typing Chronicles is an isometric, story driven, dungeon crawler with a truly unique combat system by developer Fishing Cactus.\n\nEpistory tells the story of a girl and her faithful fox steed as they attempt to repair a post-apocalyptic, tumultuous, world all through the power of typing. Players traverse a massive over-world which is unlocked one piece at a time, unfolding itself in front of the player as they progress through the story. The highlight of Epistory is the spectacularly designed map and dungeons which are far beyond what you would expect from a game of this caliber.\n\nAdditionally, the art direction of the game was an unexpected plus with its ability to tie in the art direction so beautifully and intimately with the story. The fact the origami style art in the game has a deeper meaning within the context of the story goes to show the care and heart this studio put into their game and should be noted by other developers, big and small.\n\n\n\nThe prime issue with Epistory is how tiresome the \"combat\" of the game becomes. For those who have played typing games before you know your brain an hands can only handle so much before you become fatigued and disinterested. This same issue occurs within Typing Chronicles as the more you play the more the typing based combat feels like a chore opposed to a feature. This becomes more and more apparent as the puzzles remain varied and interesting but are broken up by the more monotonous typing challenges. While introducing different \"attack types\" throughout the game does help ramp the difficulty and variability of the typing challenges it simply does not add enough excitement over the course of a 5-10 hour game.\n\nThere are additional issues with balancing of the game. While playing I only upgraded my stats 2-3 times as they never quite felt necessary to complete the missions particularly early on in the game. This would lead to me losing a typing challenge, using the stockpiled points, then having a massive power spike which allowed me to breeze through the challenge. This made the game feel less like I was developing my typing skill and instead using my artificial skill points to get past challenges.\n\nIt should be noted though, how the developers made a valiant attempt to keep the game pressing forward with their experience system. Many short (5-15 hour) games struggle to match player and story progression which leads to odd balance issues at the end of the game where the player is drastically overpowered or must grind experience to be strong enough to finish the game. Typing Chronicles does not fall into this trap and should be commended for it.\n\nThe story of Typing Chronicles, while occasionally thought provoking, quickly became a collection of disjointed audio files which were too vague and ethereal to drive player investment into the story. The bulk of the story is developed in the final chapter of the game and (without spoiling too much) essentially voids everything else we had seen and heard about the story previously. The last 20% of the game excellently developed the main character, provided context, and even tied the game play into the story. This though made the first 80% of the story feel like even more of half baked mess. \n\nOverall Epistory Typing Chronicles is a wonderful game for those looking to sharpen or test their typing skills, and should be used in every typing class moving forward. With excellent level and puzzle design the game delights with its Zelda-esque dungeon/over-world and origami based art style. The game though is held back by its repetitive combat system, odd balancing, and disjointed and overly ethereal story/tone.",

On top of that, there is an \"Arena\" area with four different levels, that is set up for you to go back in and challenge your typing skills through the bug distroying at ever increasing difficulty -as in the game, but this goes on for as long as you want to keep trying to score big. \n\nAgain, PLAY THIS if you even think you'd like it. You wont be dissapointed.\n\n*note, the game says to use EF and JI to move, which is advisable, but it will allow you to use the common WASD controlls as well",

              "review": "This is an incredible physics-based action puzzler. It's what I imagine you'd get if you crossed the Ecco the Dolphin game, with the World of Goo game with the Bladerunner movie, in terms of its combination of gameplay and atmosphere.\n\nI was going to write a review earlier when I was at level 4, but I was reading some negative reviews saying it got too hard at later points, so I decided to finish all 7 levels to be thorough. I can honestly say the challenge level was not excessive at any point. Yes there were a handful of points that I was stuck on for a while, but isn't challenge part of the reason you play games? It is for me anyway. To be honest, I feel ripped off if nothing stumps me in a whole game. And I would say all of those moments were followed by an \"Ohhh\" revelation, usually me approaching the problem in a fundamentally wrong way, or not paying close enough attention to the mechanics of the movement.\n\nIt's a joy to \"learn to walk\" in this game. The resolution between figuring out the puzzle and making your organism carry your solution out is very satisfying -- SO many \"Ohhh\" moments! The visuals are flawless as is the soundtrack, the perfect ether to immerse you in the practical aspect of the mechanics and puzzles. I also feel like a 2nd play-through to 100% all the level collectibles/achievements would be just as fun (now I just need life to give me unlimited free time kthx... *cry*).\n\nI don't get the time to play games often, but picking this game for the holidays was a great decision!\n\nIf you do play it, don't give up! Stay to experience the AMAZING CLIMAX :)\n\nIf you'd like a copy, I'll be giving away 5 free copies to the first 5 people who reply to this review!  Simply reply with \"Mushrooms are delicious!\" (or something expressing that you'd like to play the game), and I will friend you and gift it to you. (Please only people who didn't receive one of my previous giveaways.).\n\n Oh, check out DYE too, it rocks :)",

              "review": "I feel bad, but I am giving this game a mild \"Not recommended\" rating.  I feel bad because it is such an original concept and really is a good puzzle game... but it is so hard and very, very frustrating especially on the last 2-3 chapters.\n\nIn the game, you control an amobea / blob like creature.  You move by erasing part of yourself, which causes the remaining leftovers to grow in a somewhat random fashion.  Your creature can take on almost any shape, but getting how you want is not always so easy.  The goal of the game is to just reach the end of each chapter, of which there are 7.  Each level also ends with a boss, he being just another puzzle but where you need to somehow destroy him.  Things start out simple with you just needing to reach up to grab things and cross empty spaces.  By the end you will be pushing buttons, riding rockets, pushing balls and racing to make a bridge for them and many other complicated things.\n\nThis is all great but the levels are simply too long and many of the puzzles are too fiddly.  Since you grow in a somewhat random fashion, you can know what you want to do and still fail miserably at making your creature do it.  A few of the puzzles in particular will take the average player 10 to 20 attempts to complete them (you riding a rocket across a pool of acid for example).  If these difficult puzzles would have been reduced and the chapters been reduced in length, the game would have been fun and I would have recommended this.  Most players simply won't have the patience to get through to the end of the game, I almost gave up on it myself.  Those with lots of patience might want to try it out though if the concept looks intriguing, others should pass.",

The experience of being a bird, a silent observer to a country and it's citizens in strife is not for everyone. There is not a great deal of action and no danger. You fly around, collecting shiny things to adorn your nest. On your journey you listen in on conversations that make up a narrative of a country divided by hardship. You can either choose to stay and listen, or simply continue on your quest for shinies. \nThere are a few collectibles and several achievements that extend the gametime somewhat. Flying around can take some getting used to with a keyboard, hence the strong reccomendation of a controller. After a rocky start though I got the hang of it soon enough.\nThe graphics are charming in their own way, simplistic, yet lovely. The music is very fitting, soothing, giving you time to really relax. \nWhile the game may have a short play time, and not a great variety of features, what is there is a zenful gem.",

For real. \n\nHuge, huge hit. Any STG-enthousiast will enjoy this very much.",

The mechanics and controls are tight and crisp. I always felt my deaths were a result of a mistake or failure to capitalize on an opportunity, and not something bullshit like finicky controls. The game can be frustratingly difficult but not due to poor design or a lack of polish. I'm the kind of person who will get frustrated with a difficult game after a while and put down it down and never go back to it, but I go back to Nuclear Throne because I know the only thing holding me back is myself.",

But this is no ordinary one, this is one of the most fun rougelikes i've come across so far, I just can't get enough of it. I've been going at it on and off for the last 3 days. With many characters to unlock, 2 endings, an infinite mode, and daily + weekly runs, it'll keep you around for a looong time\nPros: \n+Tons of unlockable stuff.\n+All types of characters for all types of players\n+A whole lot of guns.\n+Basically a lot of content.\n+Addictive.\nCons:\n-Extremely low chance of future updates.\n-Co-op isn't all that great, and you need a mod to play online.",

              "review": "TLDR: Nuclear Throne is a top-down action game where you play as a mutant in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, where you will fight hundreds of enemies on screen at once. Nuclear Throne does everything it does seamlessly.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nSkill based, tight, focused, and fast paced. You will be on the tips of your toes, dodging projectiles, and obliterating enemies at break neck pace the entire time. There is little to no down time except for when you get to pick your mutations (PERKS) after you level up by collecting rads (XP). Mutations range from necessary to useless, and you will quickly find out the proper pecking order. Weapons also have a similar range, from the Super Plasma Cannon (think BFG from Doom) to the Screwdriver, which might as well be called a toothpick [i]if[/i] it was useful. Finding the perfect combinations [spoiler](SPC + Ultra Shovel)[/spoiler] and using your characters abilities will be some of the best action based gameplay I've seen in 10 years straight of playing shooters. I would compare the speed and mechanics as closer to Quake and Doom than most of the modern FPS scene, which won't make sense until you pick up the game. I would go at great lengths to describe every little quirk of this game, but it would be a waste. Just play it.\n\nMUSIC:\nAtmospheric, and beautiful. Just listen to it, and you'll come to the same conclusion.\n\nSTORY:\nEach character has a totally unique personality, and as the player you will be reminded of that pretty much the whole time in various unique ways. This ranges from Fish's guitar being a weapon, to Crystal polishing and grooming her body, to Plant munching on a dead bandit. The achievements all cater to their specific personalities too, which I won't spoil because it's way too much fun to find them all. The storyline also includes little quirks and details in the environments and text dialogue that it reads to you inbetween levels... All in all, this is suptle world-building at it's best and serves as a nice time waster when you're needing some down time. \n\nI easily give this game a well-deserved ten out of ten.\nJust play Nuclear Throne. Buy it, and play it. There is no reason not to.\n\nAlso, you can play this game on a toaster, so that's a plus.\n\n\n",

              "review": "The strongest arguments against this game are the hardcoded 30fps framerate and enter the gungeon.  It has the problems inherent to a game locked at 30fps, with additional problems due to gameplay design choices.\n\nMoving around is jittery in 30fps@240p.  Everything is.  The pixel art is kind of muddy.  There are a lot of cheap deaths.  Base movespeed is probably too slow for how fast enemy projectiles are, and you should probably be able to see further around you.\n\nFor comparison, let's talk about what enter the gungeon does that nuclear throne doesn't.   EtG goes on sale frequently for $7.50.  There are many more guns and they're a lot more distinct from each other.  There's a massive amount of items.  There are more bosses and enemies, which are mostly designed well.  The gameplay is more fair and intuitive.  There's a more compelling progression arc with more content to it.  Graphically, it's clean.  It supports widescreen and will run at 1440p and 144hz if you have the monitor for it.  Sound design is a lot better.\n\nI'm okay with playing Nuclear Throne for some variety, but I generally wouldn't recommend it to other people.",

I was one of the unlucky people who although was born in 90s, didn't have the chance to play a single Legend of Zelda game. This game looks and feels like one Zelda games but in with its own theme and world. I highly recommend this game to kids and adults as well. Really relaxing and good gameplay with joyful musics. I own it both on mobile and PC now but finished it on PC. I'm so happy to hear that there is a sequel coming up and hopefully a third one will also be made. \nHowever I have one tiny complaint. The fishing mechanics are really stale and not fun in my opinion. I had really hard time catching some of the fishes but finding them was even harder. Nonetheless, I went through the trouble and 100% this game. Don't miss this game out. Even the full price is worth for this game, you have my word.",

The game weapons  is nothing new. If games are going to be inspired by something at least make something new like okami like zelda, but it has new ideas to distinguish itself to make a unique rather oceanhorn is inspired by zelda but does everything what the franchise is known for such as dungeon or bosses even worst. Oceanhorn lacks creativity in puzzle design compare to zelda, as Zelda is creative and very well designed.\n\nHope Oceanhorn 2 improves it's dungeon design",

              "review": "Well this game came as a surprise.  I love strategy games, and upon reading about this, and also seeing that it was inspired by Imbroglio, I knew I had to give it a try.  Glad I did, as strategy games like this are few and far between.\n\nAs you can gather from the game's description, the core mechanic of the game is that when you move onto a hex, your shape is changed into the shape shown on that hex.  And with these different shapes, comes different abilities.  So your attacks and powers are dependant on the hex you are standing on at the time... your actual \"ship\" has zero inherant powers of it's own.  None.  You are completely dependant on the grid itself to fight back against the unending bugs.\n\nThe true depth though, is where it then goes with that mechanic.  Each hex can gain experience.  For the three offensive hexes, they gain experience each time you make a kill when you started the turn on their position.  For the three special hexes, they gain experience whenever an enemy bug dies on top of them.  Hexes get one experience point at a time, and each time a hex gains 6, it can gain new abilities, however the abilities that you can add to that hex are entirely determined by which hex types are next to it.  For example, if a smasher hex (lets you attack an adjacent enemy without moving) is levelled up, and there is a healing hex next to it, one of the options available will be to give it the ability to heal you whenever you destroy an enemy with it.  However, these upgrades arent universal:  Upgrading a smasher hex only upgrades that one specific smasher... the others on the board are unaffected.  So each smasher hex could end up with different powers depending on what is next to it when it levels up.   This means that the board's structure is EVERYTHING.  All of the strategy is determined by it.  What's more, the strategy is deepened by the position of each individual hex in relation to other hexes, as the different powers each can gain really do make a huge difference.  And lastly, after each enemy \"wave\", a variety of possible new hexes appear on the edges of the board, and you can go and choose one, expanding the board further.  The bigger it gets, the more possibilities there are, but the complications multiply as the board keeps growing.\n\nThat of course isnt enough though:  the other half of the game is the different enemies.  At the start of each wave, enemies spawn in a group onto the board.  They take two turns to spawn:  for the first turn you'll see tiny versions of them on the space they are about to appear on (and they are invincible during this) and on the next, they fully spawn.  After that, they can act.  This means that you have a bit of time to look at the positioning of new monsters and can use that free turn to react to the situation.  This is good, because these enemies get pretty nasty.  Basic bugs are simple, just coming directly at you and dying in one hit, but things get really wonky when other abilities are added to them, such as armor, the ability to snipe, or explosiveness, which outright destroys the hex it's on when the enemy dies (losing a strong, upgraded hex to an explosive foe really sucks).  The good thing is, there are ways to counter everything in the game.  THose explosive jerks for instance.  Normally, they'll ALWAYS explode when killed.  But if you have an acid hex next to another acid hex, and level one of those up, selecting the acid-based power available to it, that acid hex will not only strip enemies that land on it of their armor (which is the acid hex's default ability), but it gains the additional ability to defuse explosive enemies.  There isnt really any all-powerful combination though; the enemy selection is designed as such that they can counter you as well.  Paying attention to enemy positions in relation to absolutely every other freaking thing is important.\n\nThe best thing though is that the game is very well balanced.  Of the 6 hexes, there arent any that are going to be rarely-used, all 6 are equally important.  The same goes for all the different abilities that can be gained by each type.  And there really isnt any single strategy that will always work.  One way or another, you absolutely will have to think your way through things anew every single time, and the situation just keeps changing througout each run.\n\nThe interface is nice too.  Everything is easy to read, easy to spot, easy to use... it's all very intuitive, clean, and efficient.  And you can right click on anything for more info.\n\nThe one disadvantage the game has:  There is NO other content than this basic mode.  None.  There's no unlockables, no \"campaign\", no other modes.... this even lacks a title screen, which I find moderately baffling.  This is effectively a game in it's absolute most purified form, and for some players, that could be an issue.  The game really is ENTIRELY about the core experience.  It reminds me of alot of older arcade games in that way:  those also had no seperate modes, no unlockables... it was just the absolute pure single experience and not a single thing else, with the goal being to score as high as you can (which is the goal here too).  So, this is something you need to keep in mind when deciding wether to buy this or not.\n\nFor me though, that's not even remotely an issue.  I play alot of games that have that aspect.  And one way or another, this is just a blast to play.  And with each run being not all that long yet still very deep, it has that \"one more go\" aspect to it, and I expect this one will keep me coming back over and over again.   It's fun, it's deep, it's challenging, it's the sort of strategy game I really like.\n\nI do wish/hope that this can get released on mobile, too.  I'd absolutely love to have this on my iPad.  It would work just as well there as it does here.   But for now, this absolutely will do.   Highly recommended.",

On the surface, it's simple as heck. But it gets complicated as time goes on. One mistake leads to your ultimate downfall after a certain point. \n\nThere's so many ways this game could go, as goes for all randomized games. If you don't like sitting there repeatedly doing the same thing over and over, this probably isn't for you. If you like variance, then this would probably bore about as fast as rolling a ball back and forth. (But that's still amusing to me as well!) \n\nLike breaking your own records? Testing your tactical mind? Reptitive gameplay, simple yet so deep?\nOkay, I think I'm going over-the-top with this...\nI hope this review helps you check out this little 5$ Indie. It's a cool little game that I'm real glad I bought.",

Gameplay feels very diverse, yet it still maintains balance. All in all it feels very well thought out. \n\nThat being said there are still a few areas I think this game lacks in. The main thing being replayability. There is only one game mode. In this game mode, you start off with a map/grid of sorts, and you complete waves. After completing a wave you unlock \"tiles\" from the map. There are different types of tiles, each of which do different things and interact with other tiles in different ways. When unlocked you have somewhat of a choice of which tiles go where. \n\nHaving such a range of different tiles that interact and do different things, and having the ability to choose which tile goes where is what gives this game such a diverse feeling. But after a certain wave, all the tiles are chosen, and that diversity slowly becomes a mundane and methodical \"survival\" game (albeit there are enemies that can destroy tiles which adds another level of depth to the game). \n\nBut there could be other game modes that add a level of replayability. A timed mode where you have a certain amount of time to get to the furthest wave possible. Or you have to reach a certain wave as fast as you can. And your scores are put up against other players. Or a gamemode where the tiles and enemies for each wave is predetermined and you have to find a way to survive, bringning out more of a puzzle-esque feel. Or some form of multiplayer gamemode. Even achievements or playercards would give it some sort of replayability.\n\nBut as it stands now, there is nothing about this games that shouts for me to come back and play it again, unless I have nothing else to do and am just biding my time with something else. Don't get me wrong, I do feel as though I got my money's worth so I will recommend it, but that doesn't mean this game couldn't be better.\n\n\ntl;dr\n[u]Pros[/u]\n[list]\n  [*]Fun\n  [*]Diverse Gameplay\n  [*]Easy to learn Game Mechanics\n[/list]\n\n[u]Cons[/u]\n[list]\n  [*]Limited to one game mode\n  [*]Little to no replayability\n[/list]",

              "review": "At the time of writing I have a mere 5 minutes in Morphblade. This is because it just released on Steam. However, I have put many, many hours into the various pre-release builds, and keenly followed it through development.\n\nTo keep it brief, this game is a small, side-project made by Tom Francis, who brought you Gunpoint, is bringing you Heat Signature, and Floating Point is in the mix too. Plus other smaller projects. This is certainly a smaller project, a tiny game similar to the likes of Terry Cavanaugh, who made VVVVV and Super Hexagon. It follows the same principle, a concept, with a layer or two of depth and complexity.\n\nYou could pick this up and play it for a few minutes, or play it for five hours, either is great fun. Is it worth it for the price? Just. As a polished toy, this is just about worth the couple of quid/bucks/unit of currency that it costs.\n\n[b]In conclusion, I'd say this is simple, keeps you going with random elements, with many, many hours of fun to be had. Good job, Tom![/b]",

It plays like some sort of calvinball-chess, each tile having its uses and drawbacks, and you need to use all of them as the insectoid enemies swarm the board and overwhelm you. I enjoy the strategic aspect as much as I enjoy its throwaway nature - if I'm not feeling particularly motivated I'll throw this on for a few minutes and play around, but when I really focus on it I'm pushing to try and get the highest score I can, working out the best combination of tiles and upgrades to keep the swarm at bay.

Upgrade a Teleporter with a Repair and you'll be healed each time you teleport.<br><br>Upgrades can even be stacked, so you can end up with an Arrow that propels you with infinite range, kills everything in your path, penetrates armour, knocks back everyone near your destination, heals you, and doubles as a teleporter.<br><br>The idea for tiles determining your weapon came from the iOS game Imbroglio by Michael Brough, which is great, and Morphblade is developed and released with his permission.",
          "short_description": "In Morphblade you move around a grid slicing, smashing and bursting waves of nasty red bugs. Each tile you move to transforms you into a different weapon: on a Blades hex you can slice enemies on either side of you, on an Arrow you can launch yourself through two enemies in a row. Between waves, you choose how to build out the grid, and upgrade your most used hexes with new abilities.",
