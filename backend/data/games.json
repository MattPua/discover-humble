my play time record on steam. I have poured hundreds of hours into Spelunky on xbox. This game is hard, unforgiving, frustrating, and overall an adventure. I've had over 1,000 playthroughs and about three wins total (not taking any shortcuts). The thing to keep in mind, especially before you purchase this game- is that Spelunky is a roguelike. The purpose of the game isn't to win; the purpose of the game is to try. I can't tell you how many times I've been in a run with a whole arsenal of items at my disposal and the odds seemingly in my favor... and then I die in some stupid way. But once you get over the initial learning curve and develop a strategy that works for you- you'll learn to love the challenge. For me, I always killed the shopkeeper and used his shotgun to force my way through any situation. A run can last you anywhere from 10-20 minutes, and if you get super lucky and \"git gud\", you'll get to see where all those hours of failed runs would have got you had you survived: a notsohard boss fight and moment of realization that the game was always about the adventure, not the destination.\n\nBasically, this game provides good replayability and a lot of frustration. What else would you expect from a roguelike? Oh, and one quick word of advice from a console peasant! Use a controller; the keyboard is harder to use... You'll see.","timestamp_created":1517256722,"timestamp_updated":1517256837,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40089823","author":{"steamid":"76561198219013736","num_games_owned":57,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":26914,"playtime_last_two_weeks":5016,"last_played":1518768611},"language":"english","review":"this fucking game won't close","timestamp_created":1518655451,"timestamp_updated":1518655451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.544073","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39963800","author":{"steamid":"76561198146326272","num_games_owned":85,"num_reviews":8,"playtime_forever":755,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1517937853},"language":"english","review":"I just love Spelunky.

The concept is interesting, and it is implemented in a fun and easy to understand way. Gameplay feels very diverse, yet it still maintains balance. All in all it feels very well thought out. \n\nThat being said there are still a few areas I think this game lacks in. The main thing being replayability. There is only one game mode. In this game mode, you start off with a map/grid of sorts, and you complete waves. After completing a wave you unlock \"tiles\" from the map. There are different types of tiles, each of which do different things and interact with other tiles in different ways. When unlocked you have somewhat of a choice of which tiles go where. \n\nHaving such a range of different tiles that interact and do different things, and having the ability to choose which tile goes where is what gives this game such a diverse feeling. But after a certain wave, all the tiles are chosen, and that diversity slowly becomes a mundane and methodical \"survival\" game (albeit there are enemies that can destroy tiles which adds another level of depth to the game). \n\nBut there could be other game modes that add a level of replayability. A timed mode where you have a certain amount of time to get to the furthest wave possible. Or you have to reach a certain wave as fast as you can. And your scores are put up against other players. Or a gamemode where the tiles and enemies for each wave is predetermined and you have to find a way to survive, bringning out more of a puzzle-esque feel. Or some form of multiplayer gamemode. Even achievements or playercards would give it some sort of replayability.\n\nBut as it stands now, there is nothing about this games that shouts for me to come back and play it again, unless I have nothing else to do and am just biding my time with something else. Don't get me wrong, I do feel as though I got my money's worth so I will recommend it, but that doesn't mean this game couldn't be better.\n\n\ntl;dr\n[u]Pros[/u]\n[list]\n  [*]Fun\n  [*]Diverse Gameplay\n  [*]Easy to learn Game Mechanics\n[/list]\n\n[u]Cons[/u]\n[list]\n  [*]Limited to one game mode\n  [*]Little to no replayability\n[/list]","timestamp_created":1496761963,"timestamp_updated":1496761963,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":22,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.742601","comment_count":"2","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30339776","author":{"steamid":"76561198040884867","num_games_owned":1297,"num_reviews":684,"playtime_forever":65,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1490464629},"language":"english","review":"[b][i]Morphblade[/i] is outstanding.[/b] Reminds me of an actiony version of [i]Hexcells[/i].

I love strategy games, and upon reading about this, and also seeing that it was inspired by Imbroglio, I knew I had to give it a try.  Glad I did, as strategy games like this are few and far between.\n\nAs you can gather from the game's description, the core mechanic of the game is that when you move onto a hex, your shape is changed into the shape shown on that hex.  And with these different shapes, comes different abilities.  So your attacks and powers are dependant on the hex you are standing on at the time... your actual \"ship\" has zero inherant powers of it's own.  None.  You are completely dependant on the grid itself to fight back against the unending bugs.\n\nThe true depth though, is where it then goes with that mechanic.  Each hex can gain experience.  For the three offensive hexes, they gain experience each time you make a kill when you started the turn on their position.  For the three special hexes, they gain experience whenever an enemy bug dies on top of them.  Hexes get one experience point at a time, and each time a hex gains 6, it can gain new abilities, however the abilities that you can add to that hex are entirely determined by which hex types are next to it.  For example, if a smasher hex (lets you attack an adjacent enemy without moving) is levelled up, and there is a healing hex next to it, one of the options available will be to give it the ability to heal you whenever you destroy an enemy with it.  However, these upgrades arent universal:  Upgrading a smasher hex only upgrades that one specific smasher... the others on the board are unaffected.  So each smasher hex could end up with different powers depending on what is next to it when it levels up.   This means that the board's structure is EVERYTHING.  All of the strategy is determined by it.  What's more, the strategy is deepened by the position of each individual hex in relation to other hexes, as the different powers each can gain really do make a huge difference.  And lastly, after each enemy \"wave\", a variety of possible new hexes appear on the edges of the board, and you can go and choose one, expanding the board further.  The bigger it gets, the more possibilities there are, but the complications multiply as the board keeps growing.\n\nThat of course isnt enough though:  the other half of the game is the different enemies.  At the start of each wave, enemies spawn in a group onto the board.  They take two turns to spawn:  for the first turn you'll see tiny versions of them on the space they are about to appear on (and they are invincible during this) and on the next, they fully spawn.  After that, they can act.  This means that you have a bit of time to look at the positioning of new monsters and can use that free turn to react to the situation.  This is good, because these enemies get pretty nasty.  Basic bugs are simple, just coming directly at you and dying in one hit, but things get really wonky when other abilities are added to them, such as armor, the ability to snipe, or explosiveness, which outright destroys the hex it's on when the enemy dies (losing a strong, upgraded hex to an explosive foe really sucks).  The good thing is, there are ways to counter everything in the game.  THose explosive jerks for instance.  Normally, they'll ALWAYS explode when killed.  But if you have an acid hex next to another acid hex, and level one of those up, selecting the acid-based power available to it, that acid hex will not only strip enemies that land on it of their armor (which is the acid hex's default ability), but it gains the additional ability to defuse explosive enemies.  There isnt really any all-powerful combination though; the enemy selection is designed as such that they can counter you as well.  Paying attention to enemy positions in relation to absolutely every other freaking thing is important.\n\nThe best thing though is that the game is very well balanced.  Of the 6 hexes, there arent any that are going to be rarely-used, all 6 are equally important.  The same goes for all the different abilities that can be gained by each type.  And there really isnt any single strategy that will always work.  One way or another, you absolutely will have to think your way through things anew every single time, and the situation just keeps changing througout each run.\n\nThe interface is nice too.  Everything is easy to read, easy to spot, easy to use... it's all very intuitive, clean, and efficient.  And you can right click on anything for more info.\n\nThe one disadvantage the game has:  There is NO other content than this basic mode.  None.  There's no unlockables, no \"campaign\", no other modes.... this even lacks a title screen, which I find moderately baffling.  This is effectively a game in it's absolute most purified form, and for some players, that could be an issue.  The game really is ENTIRELY about the core experience.  It reminds me of alot of older arcade games in that way:  those also had no seperate modes, no unlockables... it was just the absolute pure single experience and not a single thing else, with the goal being to score as high as you can (which is the goal here too).  So, this is something you need to keep in mind when deciding wether to buy this or not.\n\nFor me though, that's not even remotely an issue.  I play alot of games that have that aspect.  And one way or another, this is just a blast to play.  And with each run being not all that long yet still very deep, it has that \"one more go\" aspect to it, and I expect this one will keep me coming back over and over again.   It's fun, it's deep, it's challenging, it's the sort of strategy game I really like.\n\nI do wish/hope that this can get released on mobile, too.  I'd absolutely love to have this on my iPad.  It would work just as well there as it does here.   But for now, this absolutely will do.   Highly recommended.","timestamp_created":1488729099,"timestamp_updated":1488729099,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.590851","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"30320822","author":{"steamid":"76561198037222425","num_games_owned":304,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":629,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1512944651},"language":"english","review":"Wow!

I'm also always looking for good local-coop games to play together with my two boys.\n\nTechnically, the game is flawless.  Smooth fast graphics, highly responsive, no lag, great sound and pretty pictures.   Also, I've always enjoyed rogue-like games and this was a nice twist.\n\nUnfortunately, that's about it in terms of gameplay.  Not to be crass, but it feels like a school group project - a roguelike game made by committee that's a mile wide and an inch deep.  Like any game, once the pretty pictures wear off, there needs to be something of substance behind it.  Even the original nethack games had a leveling system - and with good reason!  You need some reason to keep playing and go for just one more dungeon.   More than 4 monsters and a few bosses would be a good start. \n\nI guess it's easier to give a school grade for solid graphics and technical savvy then it is to judge depth or playability.

Liked all of the classes; you have to experiment and find one to suit your playstyle. I thought I'd like the Knight the most, but so far the Archer is my favorite. It's not as good close up, but if you can get some distance and find an area to bottleneck the enemies, it's good for crowd control. Generally, I go room to room, then try and find either a boss, treasure, or an area to keep them at bay so I can rack up health drops. Overall it's definitely fun, but I think it's more suited towards playing with your friends. It's very difficult to play by yourself, but still fun. The music really puts a punctuation on everything and is really great. I'd love to see a few more modes and levels eventually, maybe even a campaign like a Spyro-esque mode where you teleport to different worlds and fight their bosses, but I understand that's a lot more work for the future. Great game and definitely recommending.","timestamp_created":1472695899,"timestamp_updated":1472695899,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.618364","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"25291094","author":{"steamid":"76561198059753061","num_games_owned":35,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":29,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1477850356},"language":"english","review":"Start game.\nSelect a class (out of 4).\nStart session (solo or coop).\nFight enemies and a boss.\nFind the portal to end session.\nWhoever entered the portal won that game session.\n\nVery basic gameplay.\nNo looting of better equipment.\nNo leveling.\nNo skill point system or talent tree.\nNo character customization.\nNo reward for 'Winning'.\nNo nothing.

It was published by Activision in 1981. One or two players control chickens who can be made to run across a ten lane highway filled with traffic in an effort to \"get to the other side.\" Every time a chicken gets across a point is earned for that player. If hit by a car, a chicken is forced back either slightly, or pushed back to the bottom of the screen, depending on what difficulty the switch is set to. The winner of a two player game is the player who has scored the most points in the two minutes, sixteen seconds allotted. The chickens are only allowed to move up or down. A cluck sound is heard when a chicken is struck by a car. Comparisons are often made to Frogger, which has also features crossing a street filled with moving vehicles. Similarities did help sales when Frogger was popular in the arcades and a home version was not yet available. \n \nFreeway was made available on Microsoft's Game Room service for its Xbox 360 console and for Windows-based PCs on August 18, 2010.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[28856,36662,24918,19539,67625,58785,40470,26709,29132,18393],"tags":[1,268435466,268435489,536871682,536872695,536874337,536875069,536875088,536875117,536875404,536880778,536883082,1073741827],"developers":[66],"publishers":[66],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[770,1783,3425,4157,4176,4205,4492,9866,12170],"themes":[1],"genres":[10,33],"first_release_date":378604800000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":378604800000,"region":2,"human":"1981","y":1981,"m":12}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"4xzU1rmyGXs"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zbqjbnmyrpmwaxrvscnl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zbqjbnmyrpmwaxrvscnl","width":1530,"height":2100},"esrb":{"rating":3}},"humbleBundle":{"bundle":"gamemaker_bundle","custom_download_page_box_html":"","downloads":[{"android_app_only":false,"download_identifier":null,"download_struct":[{"file_size":5664256,"human_size":"5.4 MB","md5":"42d68ca870d8dea5cce9ec772c7d7b18","name":"Download","small":0,"uploaded_at":"2016-08-29T22:28:17.282130","url":{"bittorrent":"https://dl.humble.com/torrents/FreewayMutant.exe.torrent?gamekey=MR85kTzCuTf8D6AB&ttl=1519664844&t=4342976de5843acc268877d2b48ce246","web":"https://dl.humble.com/FreewayMutant.exe?gamekey=MR85kTzCuTf8D6AB&ttl=1519664844&t=71736d67106e6ad8232d508e02a81004"}}],"download_version_number":null,"machine_name":"freewaymutant_windows","options_dict":{},"platform":"windows"}],"human_name":"Freeway Mutant","icon":"https://humblebundle.imgix.net/misc/files/hashed/41b4cd6b0348bcb00d725c80002a92351cb52bb4.png?auto=format&s=6815384f5325b45c816246e5b230e26f","library_family_name":"","machine_name":"freewaymutant","payee":{"human_name":"Butterscotch Shenanigans","machine_name":"butterscotchshenanigans"},"url":"https://www.bscotch.net/games"},"steam":{"reviews":null,"appDetails":null}},{"humbleBundle":{"bundle":"jumbobundle6","custom_download_page_box_html":"","downloads":[{"android_app_only":false,"download_identifier":"","download_struct":[{"file_size":72399899,"human_size":"69 MB","md5":"47ab2fa92539f2a683b619ec1d718cb4","name":"MP3","small":0,"url":{"bittorrent":"https://dl.humble.com/torrents/SC_Soundtrack.zip.torrent?gamekey=5UEeXfKw5s2a3uFn&ttl=1519664844&t=7da0aaba03027305d3754db371e9a66e","web":"https://dl.humble.com/SC_Soundtrack.zip?gamekey=5UEeXfKw5s2a3uFn&ttl=1519664844&t=d07c22ae8ee8c3175f5909bcb3f60662"}}],"download_version_number":null,"machine_name":"shadowrunchronicles_audio","options_dict":{},"platform":"audio"}],"human_name":"Shadowrun Chronicles: Soundtrack","icon":"https://humblebundle.imgix.net/misc/files/hashed/58d3a29268fda7d34eea72cfff82d3aadee50292.png?auto=format&s=ba09885488177e8013afa631d35322cd","library_family_name":"","machine_name":"shadowrunchronicles_soundtrack","payee":{"human_name":"Cliffhanger Productions","machine_name":"cliffhangerproductions"},"url":"http://www.cliffhanger-productions.com/"},"steam":{"reviews":null,"appDetails":null}},{"igdb":{"id":22713,"name":"Gunmetal Arcadia Zero","slug":"gunmetal-arcadia-zero","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/gunmetal-arcadia-zero","created_at":1471482842800,"updated_at":1519226095597,"summary":"Unrest brews in the city of Arcadia, and a monstrous enemy approaches.

that led to Outlast, and stretches past the events of the first game to show the true final chapter in the story of Mount Massive Asylum. \nOutlast: Whistleblower follows the story of Waylon Park, the

his time at Mount Massive, during which he has been unable to even contact his wife and son thanks to strict security protocols.

was a hell of a game. It will make you shiver, cry out loud, and shall give you dreams...only for nightmares. Outlast is not like any other horror game: it has a good story. It doesn’t repeat the same scenes- it is always different. The characters, oh the terrifying characters, will be the only things you imagine. The graphics for this thrilling game are amazing and makes this game realistic. The game lay is on-point, it isn’t too hard to spot things and if your there (Lillie an idiot) standing, forgetting the controls it will sometimes remind you so you don’t spend 10 minutes seeking for a shitty YouTube tutorial with shitty commentary. I highly recommend this game! But I warn you...if you are scared of people being chased... this game will make your life a living horror.","timestamp_created":1517609290,"timestamp_updated":1517609290,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523810","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39944718","author":{"steamid":"76561198168350486","num_games_owned":33,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":729,"playtime_last_two_weeks":37,"last_played":1518649861},"language":"english","review":"This is an amazing game for those who love a good scare, have a tough stomach, and those who are very mature overall.

I cannot believe how well the developers did when they created the asylum.  The environments, the sounds, the lighting—it was all amazingly done.  I originally put this down during one of the chase scenes, as I didn’t really feel like being stressed out by a video game.  I just didn’t find it fun.  I picked it up a year later with a friend, and I told myself that I was just going to power through that part.\n\nI am so glad I did.\n\nWe still talk about the experiences we had in this game.  It is just so well done!  It’s creepy, it’s fun, and it nails just about everything I was looking for in a true horror game.\n\nThe only two complaints I have:  One would be the end section.  The pacing took a really weird turn for the last hour or so.  I could see what they were going for, but to change the pacing and focus so drastically was very jarring.  The rest of the game had such a distinct tempo for the first five hours, and abruptly changing it for the last hour was a slight misstep.  \n\nMy second complaint is that I think we should be able to save/watch all of the camera footage we recorded during the play through.  How cool would that be??  It would cut in and out randomly as the camera was used (mostly in dark sections), and it would probably be a terrifying watch.  Just a thought :)\n\nOverall, a really great game, and I definitely recommend it.  Thanks to the devs!\n","timestamp_created":1518845284,"timestamp_updated":1518845284,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545455","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39926684","author":{"steamid":"76561198434835796","num_games_owned":100,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":283,"playtime_last_two_weeks":22,"last_played":1519230504},"language":"english","review":"yeah realy good game because:\n# when you fear your heart work more and its exciting \n# there is a achievment that you must find all document so this achievment increase your adventure sense\n# this game is funny!

island.","collection":1142,"rating":90.9408292272262,"popularity":4,"aggregated_rating":87.5,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":89.2204146136131,"total_rating_count":24,"rating_count":21,"games":[12517,1026,6328,472,12597,533,1879,9061,832,7386],"tags":[17,21,268435465,268435468,268435487,268435488,536870984,536871029,536871041,536871059,536871071,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871244,536871390,536871422,536871506,536871570,536871581,536871599,536871609,536871610,536871632,536871776,536871878,536871931,536871938,536871980,536872010,536872064,536872070,536872098,536872121,536872140,536872201,536872225,536872257,536872334,536872371,536872406,536872419,536872425,536872647,536872649,536872668,536872810,536872835,536872898,536872983,536873023,536873024,536873066,536873326,536873362,536873364,536873384,536873425,536873454,536873473,536873590,536873787,536873949,536873973,536874115,536874398,536874688,536874706,536874743,536874745,536874830,536874873,536874916,536874943,536875046,536875050,536875055,536875062,536875083,536875089,536875091,536875095,536875099,536875101,536875106,536875124,536875130,536875147,536875151,536875169,536875187,536875196,536875200,536875215,536875228,536875229,536875231,536875232,536875244,536875262,536875265,536875271,536875275,536875302,536875304,536875305,536875306,536875307,536875313,536875315,536875323,536875327,536875330,536875331,536875336,536875342,536875344,536875358,536875362,536875372,536875377,536875388,536875396,536875420,536875421,536875452,536875455,536875464,536875480,536875485,536875492,536875493,536875494,536875496,536875502,536875505,536875517,536875523,536875524,536875531,536875532,536875539,536875540,536875554,536875606,536875608,536875621,536875639,536875668,536875671,536875675,536875691,536875693,536875699,536875701,536875732,536875735,536875738,536875741,536875744,536875745,536875752,536875760,536875776,536875777,536875778,536875791,536875792,536875819,536875822,536875830,536875832,536875852,536875870,536875886,536875891,536875892,536875896,536875902,536875911,536875912,536875914,536875915,536875930,536875934,536875941,536875951,536875952,536876007,536876010,536876011,536876014,536876016,536876029,536876031,536876032,536876034,536876060,536876069,536876076,536876084,536876093,536876094,536876095,536876105,536876124,536876126,536876195,536876270,536876271,536876273,536876277,536876285,536876286,536876287,536876298,536876318,536876334,536876368,536876373,536876374,536876377,536876379,536876413,536876447,536876450,536876457,536876473,536876474,536876489,536876521,536876528,536876536,536876546,536876571,536876574,536876577,536876588,536876594,536876598,536876600,536876605,536876606,536876612,536876617,536876618,536876625,536876643,536876706,536876708,536876711,536876731,536876732,536876748,536876752,536876769,536876847,536876875,536876876,536876879,536876880,536876881,536876882,536876967,536877053,536877165,536877207,536877290,536877296,536877308,536877319,536877379,536877434,536877438,536877453,536877510,536877565,536877566,536877583,536877586,536877587,536877652,536877666,536877672,536877749,536877753,536877755,536877892,536877907,536877908,536877915,536877959,536877960,536878034,536878072,536878073,536878146,536878147,536878216,536878281,536878293,536878308,536878317,536878335,536878346,536878379,536878385,536878417,536878480,536878489,536878499,536878513,536878514,536878515,536878516,536878517,536878518,536878519,536878520,536878521,536878522,536878523,536878524,536878525,536878526,536878527,536878528,536878529,536878530,536878531,536878532,536878533,536878534,536878535,536878536,1073741825],"developers":[2765],"publishers":[2765],"game_engines":[149],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[72,117,129,147,159,226,227,296,301,332,478,510,594,658,669,687,697,698,720,864,966,1019,1026,1068,1098,1152,1158,1186,1209,1228,1289,1313,1345,1422,1459,1494,1507,1513,1735,1737,1756,1898,1923,1986,2071,2111,2112,2154,2414,2450,2452,2472,2513,2542,2561,2678,2875,3037,3061,3203,3486,3776,3794,3831,3833,3918,3961,4004,4031,4134,4138,4143,4150,4171,4177,4179,4183,4187,4189,4194,4212,4218,4235,4239,4257,4275,4284,4288,4303,4316,4317,4319,4320,4332,4350,4353,4359,4363,4390,4392,4393,4394,4395,4401,4403,4411,4415,4418,4419,4424,4430,4432,4446,4450,4460,4465,4476,4484,4508,4509,4540,4543,4552,4568,4573,4580,4581,4582,4584,4590,4593,4605,4611,4612,4619,4620,4627,4628,4642,4694,4696,4709,4727,4756,4759,4763,4779,4781,4787,4789,4820,4823,4826,4829,4832,4833,4840,4848,4864,4865,4866,4879,4880,4907,4910,4918,4920,4940,4958,4974,4979,4980,4984,4990,4999,5000,5002,5003,5018,5022,5029,5039,5040,5095,5098,5099,5102,5104,5117,5119,5120,5122,5148,5157,5164,5172,5181,5182,5183,5193,5212,5214,5283,5358,5359,5361,5365,5373,5374,5375,5386,5406,5422,5456,5461,5462,5465,5467,5501,5535,5538,5545,5561,5562,5577,5609,5616,5624,5634,5659,5662,5665,5676,5682,5686,5688,5693,5694,5700,5705,5706,5713,5731,5794,5796,5799,5819,5820,5836,5840,5857,5935,5963,5964,596

a few months back I decided to play the [b]Legend of Grimrock[/b] series. I wanted to go retro and revisit a dungeon crawler type of game I grew up on (late 80s early 90s) and through a bundle deal I grabbed both games.  \n\nHere is my [h1]Legend of Grimrock Review?[/h1] \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/id/Euther/recommended/207170/\n\n[h1]So, What is the Legend of Grimrock 2 (LOG2) game about?[/h1]\nLOG2 is the 2nd game in the series and continues being an action role-playing video game developed and published by Almost Human. It is the sequel to the 2012 title Legend of Grimrock, and was released for Microsoft Windows for PC on October 2014. Like LOG, it is a first-person action role-playing game with realtime game mechanics. The Player again manages a party of up to 4 NPCs which they move through a grid-based dungeon. \n\n[h1]Plot[/h1]\nLike LOG, the player in the game is again a prisoner. The games starts out where you and three- (3) other prisoners are located in the hull of a prison transport ship, in a cage... Yea! How Joyous!\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=881107422\nAs a result of a strong storm and unknown magic (hehehe) the party of prisoners gets stranded on the mysterious Island of Nex. The prisoners need to explore the island and discover its secrets if they are to survive. Unlike LOG, this game is played outside and inside. You will travel through forests, rivers and swamps, as well as, ancient ruins and crypts below the island. \n\nThere is another Big Bad Guy, too, the elusive Island Master who alternates between providing hints to the prisoners and taunting them of upcoming challenges.\n\nThe party of prisoners will need to gather a elemental gems scattered around the island, and use them to enter the Castle that towers in the middle of the island. On top of the castle, they encounter the Island Master! Defeating him is possibly their only escape... or is it?\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nGameplay consists of using a Keyboard/Mouse to navigate through the the Island, Underground Dungeons, solving a combination of puzzles and combat. Characters within the party gain experience for slaying creatures and beasts within, allowing them to increase in level and progress skills which enhance combat abilities and allow the casting of new spells, and equipment is obtained through exploration and solving of puzzles throughout the dungeon. \n\n[h1]Game Thoughts:[/h1]\nI had a blast with this game, too. It met my expectations of an Action Role-Playing, Dungeon Crawler set in an atmosphere of constant dread and mortal danger. \n\n- Multiple Endings... :D\n- Graphics are still just OK. Respective to the year of release. Could use retexuring and re-releasing!\n- Great atmosphere and story, IMO,\n- Awesome soundtrack,\n- Boss fights were not so challenging (for me) one you learn the \"fighting dance\", Google it!\n- Highly repayable if you have the time. \n- Via the Dungeon Editor - Plenty of Dungeon & Quest MODs attached to the steam workshop!\n- For me, 106 hrs to complete base game + Item Collections + Achievement Hunting,\n- 1st Playthrough achievement progress: 56 of 60 (93%) achievements earned\n- Normally $24... I'd wait for a sale.... or catch the bundle\n- Great game!\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/251730/Legend_of_Grimrock_2/","timestamp_created":1514759513,"timestamp_updated":1514761199,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":21,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.734792","comment_count":"6","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38813781","author":{"steamid":"76561198017140663","num_games_owned":96,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":5121,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1488673008},"language":"english","review":"One of the best games I've ever played.\nThe dungeoning, the gameplay, the puzzles... oh god and the amazing atmosphere. You really feel like you're in the game itself, fighting to survive out there, trying to solve the mystery of the island. I love how some of the dungeons legitimately frighten you, like the graveyard, the pyramid and the final dungeon. Kept going forward at a snail's pace, haha.

There are few games that have produced as many smiles as this game has on the faces of myself and friends. Even if we lose it is a rambunctious and loud uproar of laughter, fun, and disbelief. I have multiple bomb manuals printed off so each player that isn't at the computer can have their own roles. Like I mentioned, I feel this game plays perfectly with 3 - maybe 4 - people, the more people that are involved the less efficient communicating becomes and then some people lose out on opportunities to help defuse the bombwithin the round. Anytime I have someone who hasn't played the game before, I seat them in front of the computer to act as the bomb defuser, it's great because I can first act as a role model for players using the manual and help show through example how to communicate effectively whilst the new player is anxiously attempting to defuse the bomb trusting my information. Keep talking and Nobody Explodes is definitely a novelty and as such it loses its splendor fairly quickly. This game is best played a few rounds at a time with new people several months in between to keep it fresh! If you're looking for a fun, highly-cooperative, party-game than look no further, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes is absolutely brilliant and fills a game genre I never knew I needed until I played this game. I can't recommend this game enough for what it is, buy it!","timestamp_created":1518142697,"timestamp_updated":1518142697,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":29,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.703293","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39639430","author":{"steamid":"76561197991059139","num_games_owned":557,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":208,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1517005243},"language":"english","review":"A master class in frantic, fast paced and engaging gameplay.\nEasy to play and understand, fiendish to master.\nThe best Co-op/Party game I have played ever!","timestamp_created":1517005550,"timestamp_updated":1517005550,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.621849","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39856496","author":{"steamid":"76561198811175268","num_games_owned":1,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":803,"playtime_last_two_weeks":509,"last_played":1519417662},"language":"english","review":"This is THE GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME, because it requires a wide range of skills and therefore appeals to many different players. Your optimal defusing team should include word people, visual people, strategic problem-solvers, multitaskers, and at least one person with an excellent memory.

rogue-like elements. The game takes place inside an arcology – a massive sci-fi mega structure.

Upgrade your character stats, discover new cybernetic enhancements and build up strength to finally stop the Overseer. Every death is a new beginning – the path to stopping the Overseer is never the

Please understand that this is a puzzle, not a means to learn programming. Personally i am not a puzzle guy, but the game is quite hard, so i guess it is a good puzzler.\n\nInstead, this review will focus on analyzing the programming part of the game.\n\nYou have all this box setup of 3x4. The amount of boxes available to you depends on the puzzle. Each box allows for 12 line of code. Each box has arrows from it to the adjacent boxes. That's for controlling I/O. \n\nYou get the MOV command to control I/O. Down are the 4 cases on how you can use this command.\n\nMOV 10 UP - for example moves value 10 to the box above the current one.\n\nMOV UP DOWN - takes input from the box above, and sends it to the box below itself.\n\nMOV UP ACC - takes input from the upper box, and puts it into a variable called ACC.\n\nMOV UP NIL - takes the input, and discards it.\n\nAlso, the MOV command logic requires the upper box to be free when doing MOV 10 UP for example. Same for the MOV UP DOWN, which requires the upper box to have some input waiting in there. If the necessary direction is not free, or the input is not there, the code in that box halts on that line.\n\nEach box has 2 variables called ACC and BAK, and a command to switch the values. ACC is interactable, and BAK is not. The only way to interact with BAK is to switch it.\n\nThe ALU in this language is a mess.\n\nYou have ADD and SUB.\n\nADD VALUE\n\nValue gets added to the ACC.\n\nThere is no multiplication. The closest thing you get is multiplication by 2 - ADD ACC.\n\nThis is an assembly language, so there are labels, and branch commands. The comparison operators are however a piece of work.\n\nYou get ACC == 0, ACC != 0, ACC > 0, ACC < 0.\n\nThe code is run line by line, 1 line at a time. When the box reaches the last line, it starts over. Each box has to communicate in synchrony, and that's where halting with MOV comes in for example.\n\nThere is also a branch for jumping lines, called JRO VALUE. JRO 1 will go to the next line. JRO -1 to the previous line. JRO 0 will stay on the same line, which makes it run indefinately and thus stops the execution in that box.\n\nThere is also NOP, which is a dummy command. Since the game runs code 1 line at a time, NOP is another command to synchronize the boxes.\n\nIf you wanna know more, there is a manual on this game. Just search for it on net.\n\nPersonally, i find this to be a very frustrating and limiting langauge. If this was the way programs were wrote, i wouldn't be a programmer.","timestamp_created":1518817607,"timestamp_updated":1518817607,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.495868","comment_count":"1","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}]},"appDetails":{"type":"game","name":"TIS-100","steam_appid":370360,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"<img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/370360/extras/header1.jpg?t=1491845789\" ><br><br>TIS-100 is an open-ended programming game by Zachtronics, the creators of SpaceChem and Infinifactory, in which you rewrite corrupted code segments to repair the TIS-100 and unlock its secrets.

The overall atmosphere of the game is so dark and creepy, and I loved that. It's kinda like scifi-horror version of BioShock. Just by the fact that you're under the sea got me anxious lol. But anxious in a good way.\n\nSOMA has pretty much like Amnesia style of gameplay. I don't know is it just me, but there were parts where you were kinda left on your own to think what you should do. Kind of like where you should go and what you should be doing. Because there are no objective markers or anything.

And between that, moments so beautifully poignant and serene. \n This is an incredibly well written game, finely tuned and edited for maximum enjoyment.  Great script as well, and graphics and sound are well above average, especially for a small-budget title.\n\nLows: Not many.  It's a relatively short game and linear, so replay value is limited?

In [i]SOMA[/i] the additive becomes subtractive: how much can be taken away from a human and leave them still human?\n\nAlso the sound design is great.","timestamp_created":1517695229,"timestamp_updated":1517695229,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.551614","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40108575","author":{"steamid":"76561197993464349","num_games_owned":181,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":665,"last_played":1518687283},"language":"english","review":"This game should be a sci fi movie!

This is a very depressing game. The philosophical implications in the story are grim, but probably not beyond your grasp prior to playing. The REAL feeling of despair comes from the presentation of a hopeless fate for humanity and frequent allusions to a future where you are truly alone in the world. If you get this game expecting the typical formula of growth through triumph that most horror films and games have adopted, you will probably end up bored and upset. If this is the case, you may want to stick to your Outlast and Resident Evil.\n\n2. If you \"die,\" head back to your last save. This is essential if you desire challenge in your games. My first playthrough, I went through the first several chapters without getting touched by the monsters. They are loud, perceptive, and they disrupt your UI when near. When I finally learned through experience that they only stun you then fuck off, it took away some of the fear for me. So in this case, you will benefit from hancicapping yourself.\n\n3. The main character of this game is an idiot. Not just a bonehead or a bumpkin blissfully unaware of his stupidity. He asks the same dumb shit over and over and keeps acting shocked when his iPod girlfriend gives him an answer he doesn't like. If you have no experience with the autistic, you will hate the MC.

I was amazed with how they implemented the sanity meter and how the gameplay was focused on ways you can sneak through areas while having to avoid the monster that roams the area without a means of fighting. Thus, it was to my pleasant surprise when frictional games announced about their new and upcoming game that would involve psychological horror with robots possessing human consciences  which I found out through watching their teaser trailers prior to the release of their game and boy was I super excited for it to come out! Unfortunately, when soma came out in 2015, I was too preoccupied with real world problems and since I didn't hear too much about how well soma did, my excitement for the game died down. Now that I have more free time, I decided to browse through games from the recent steam sale and that was when soma was brought back to my attention. I bought the game, not expecting much out of it and to my surprise I fell in love with it! Upon taking breaks inbetween, I'd have the urge to continue playing the game out of curiosity to know more about how the story would progress and man was I glad to have made that purchase! So on to the review!\n\nFirst, let's address the elephant in the room which would be the horror and gameplay. Let me say this first, horror is subjective, each and everyone has their own fears and something that 1 person deems scary might not seem scary to another. I personally felt that the monster designs were intriguing rather than scary. I was even in awe when I encountered the 1st monster and went up close to it but got killed instead XD Ways to evade monsters work very similarly to those you've encountered back in the previous Amnesia games; some are blind and are more sensitive to sound so making as little noise as possible is advised (i.e., avoid opening doors which makes a lot of noise, don't run, don't move when confronted) while some are more sensitive to how close you are so keeping your distance is advised. Information regarding advice on how to evade the monsters can be learnt through reading notes and listening to audio recordings. Although the monsters each have unique characteristics which can be used to your advantage when being confronted by them, most of the time you can just outrun the enemies and proceed to hiding unless you're in a particularly enclosed area where you'd encounter a lot of dead ends. The objective for each area would usually involve accessing security monitors to unlock certain locked doors or retrieving certain items required to proceed further while avoiding the monster that roams the area which work very much like amnesia and penumbra.\n\nThe sanity meter from amnesia also doesn't make an appearance which I thought was 1 of the main selling points for amnesia though this might be nitpicking since soma's focus is not exactly the horror that amnesia was going for. Surprisingly, I still had some heart-pounding moments while I crouched down, hiding and waiting for the monster to not notice my presence. The sound-design and beautifully rendered graphics also definitely helped bring a sense of eeriness and hopelessness with regards to the predicament that your character is in. A few people have mentioned that it would've been better if the monsters were removed from the game since they interfere with the player's ease of accessing various rooms to look up more information on the backstory of the game but considering that the monsters play a huge role in the narrative, I think it's more of a problem regarding how the areas are designed. Fortunately, for players who did find the need to hide from the monsters an issue, frictional games has added a \"safe mode\" which prevents the monsters from attacking you so that you can freely roam through the map. \n \nNext up would be story which is the game's main selling point. I kid you not, I think the premise and the story is one for the big screen but I won't spoil it to anticipating players, you'll have to play the game to find out;) I'll just say that the story involves a lot of philosophical issues regarding life and what it means to be human and frictional games made such a unique concept out of it, it's brilliant! Voice acting is sorta all over the place, the main protagonist sounds unnatural during the first few scenes but for some reason, it seems to get better as the story progresses to the point that some of the dialogue acted out during the serious moments caused me to empathize for the character a lot. He also goes on to meet another supporting character and I honestly can't get enough of their interactions together as they ponder about their existence and their ideologies. A few people have criticized the game for having a few plot holes and inconsistencies here and there but, unless you've finished the game and looked up all documents and audio logs in the game, I don't think one has the right to judge the game in such a way. I personally think they tied up the story's loose ends pretty well. \n\nTo sum up, this game was such an amazing experience. Initially I was just excited about how the story would unravel with such an amazing premise but along the way, I started wondering about the philosophical issues brought up by the characters in the game and I came to love the characters a lot as well. I will never forget about this game and I think it's safe to say that it's now my favorite horror game of all time. That was such a roller coaster of feels:,) I highly encourage that you go play this game if you haven't and if you're a fan of sci-fi thrillers!","timestamp_created":1517320507,"timestamp_updated":1517373736,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523810","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40237015","author":{"steamid":"76561198057448544","num_games_owned":268,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":529,"playtime_last_two_weeks":342,"last_played":1518604538},"language":"english","review":"You've sobbed from existential dread in front of a disinterested woman before but now you can do it UNDERWATER","timestamp_created":1519078796,"timestamp_updated":1519078796,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521739","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}]},"appDetails":{"type":"game","name":"SOMA","steam_appid":282140,"required_age":"17","is_free":false,"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"SOMA is a sci-fi horror game from Frictional Games, the creators of Amnesia: The Dark Descent.

I picked it up on a 15% sale and it was easily worth it. It does a really great job displaying childrens' emotions, dialouges, and thought processes. In my first playthrough alone the story dealt with themes of honesty, bullying, racism, childhood romance, growing up, and nostalgic summers. The story makes you feel like a kid again, especially reminiscent of adults purposefully keeping secrets in fear of you not being able to emotionally comprehend difficult situations.

The game is very simple to play, with the player primarily making a few choices through dialogue and who to interact with. You play as Dana, who becomes a babysitter to younger girl Kimmy. During the days that you babysit, you have a limited amount of time to play with other kids, buy toys and games, and learn more about the residents of your town. As with many of Nina Freeman’s games, what appears on the surface to be a normal 1960’s summer is in fact a dark, mature tale of the struggles that many families face. The game moves along at a good pace, taking you from interaction to interaction without much fuss and hardly a single wasted word throughout the entire game. It is very interesting to see the world through the eyes of a young girl at that time – I can’t think of any other game where the player takes the role of a middle-school-aged-girl. \n\tOverall, it is a very interesting and impactful game that doesn’t take too long to tell its story. If you are a big fan of story in games, or just find this premise interesting, I’d definitely recommend picking Kimmy up! There is a demo on Steam, and the game is available on PC and Mac.","timestamp_created":1494182121,"timestamp_updated":1494182121,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502712","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"31519642","author":{"steamid":"76561197978043120","num_games_owned":255,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":78,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1493796298},"language":"english","review":"I got this game because I'm a fan of Nina's (she makes interesting games and she's a total fox!).

No exploration, no shooting. Only moving and jumping. \n\nWhat else is there? A self-contained level whose borders you can cross to find yourself on the other side, and traps. Tons of traps that cycle during the duration of the level. Machine-guns, homing missiles, bubble-gum to make the platforms sticky while a see-saw journeys across… The goal of the game is to collect items that spawn in the level while avoiding different sets of traps. Simple, and yet effective.\n\nThis game is exactly what I was looking for. I am quite sick of the ‘muscle memory’ platformers where you have to learn by heart at which point of the level you jump, the perfect trajectory to land between spikes, and so on. Penarium focuses on the moment-to-moment frantic experience. Quick skills are required instead of a good finger memory, and it is rather telling that less than 20% of the players completed the 1st world. Penarium is very difficult, and as it sports a “sadistic circus” theme, you would have to be a masochist to like it. \n\nAnd yet I never found its difficulty to cross the “unfair” invisible line. The hitbox of the character is actually smaller than he looks. The movements are perfect, with double-jump and responsive controls without either the sliding momentum or the input delay that harm many platformers. The traps are more or less hard to avoid, but all can be predictable or give the player visual cues. But yeah, quick thinking and fast reflexes are mandatory. Oh, and I really appreciate that there is no timer adding an external pressure to the action. It is possible to either rush through the traps, or time them carefully. \n\nSo despite the high difficulty, moving like a madman and surviving amongst the chaos is exhilarating. It is fun. It does not feel like the game is punishing the player, because the action is constant and the threats come from everywhere while still being manageable. And the variety/movement of traps help make the game not feel repetitive. It can be finished in a few hours, and this type of game is not enjoyable if it gets much longer than that. To extend the fun, there is an endless mode with permanent progression.\n\nTo conclude, I was surprised to love this simple game so much more than the other hardcore platformers. I think it’s due to the good maneuverability, the difficult yet manageable design, and most of all the dynamic traps that require quick skills and provide a lot of fun by getting rid of the ‘muscle memory’ level design that usually goes with that kind of platformers.  \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=712733656\n","timestamp_created":1467127755,"timestamp_updated":1467127755,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.647842","comment_count":"2","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"23442930","author":{"steamid":"76561198008885269","num_games_owned":146,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":502,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1464121643},"language":"english","review":"Oh the joy and the lower back pains this game gave me..\nPenarium is an addictive game.

It is short, but it's exactly as long as it needs to be. There's something to be said for a game that can be completed in a single sitting, and never feel repetitive or like it's dragging its feet.\n\nI was going to criticise it for being simple. It is simple, but its simplicity is elegant. The combinations of its approximately 15 traps make for some beautifully intense and varied gameplay.\n\nI was going to criticise it for playing like a bonus challenge minigame at the end of a more fleshed-out game. It is reminiscent of a bonus challenge minigame, but unlike such games, it's well-designed, balanced, clever, and difficult to master.\n\nSo now, given the satisfying, challenging gameplay, beautifully realised pixel-art, and surprisingly engrossing setting and characters, I'm left with only one complaint:\n\nWhy is it that a rolling rock that could (and often will) crush me in an instant, does not crush the barrels I'm supposed to break!?","timestamp_created":1454845983,"timestamp_updated":1454845983,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.000000","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"21728731","author":{"steamid":"76561198005285810","num_games_owned":118,"num_reviews":11,"playtime_forever":612,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1455629790},"language":"english","review":"I had been playing this game for around half an hour every day for several months, trying to complete the campaign mode. I got all the way up to the last level and I couldn't beat it. Took a break for a few months and went back to try again. It took me a week but I finally completed campaign mode.\n\nThis game is insanely difficult, and so many times I died from either missing a jump or barely touching one of the many obstacles. I hate the birds, the dragons, the rockets and those icicles, and I have no idea how you can break more than 50 of those barrels.\n\nSo overall I enjoyed Penarium and felt so satisfied beating it.","timestamp_created":1457532451,"timestamp_updated":1457532451,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.000000","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"34397585","author":{"steamid":"76561198032045840","num_games_owned":214,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":362,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1514422662},"language":"english","review":"Engraçado e difícil =D","timestamp_created":1503330345,"timestamp_updated":1503330345,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.000000","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}]},"appDetails":{"type":"game","name":"Penarium","steam_appid":307590,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"controller_support":"full","detailed_description":"Penarium is set in a sinister circus arena, where contestants, much like Gladiators of old, are forced to entertain a sadistic crowd.

soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. \n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. \n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.","rating":80.0802863632903,"popularity":8.666666666666668,"aggregated_rating":82,"aggregated_rating_count":5,"total_rating":81.04014318164515,"total_rating_count":76,"rating_count":71,"games":[19301,18167,19934,19290,21642,25311,29173,26145,11423,18918],"tags":[21,23,31,39,268435469,268435471,268435487,268435488,536870913,536871251,536871422,536871939,536872019,536873006,536873364,536874694,536875171,536875197,536875340,536875432,536875638,536875781,536875783,536876228,536876239,536876291,536876416,536876469,536876544,536876912,536876970,536877304,536877387,536877645,536877652,1073741828],"developers":[4133],"publishers":[4133],"game_engines":[52],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1,339,510,1027,1107,2094,2452,3782,4259,4285,4428,4520,4726,4869,4871,5316,5327,5379,5504,5557,5632,6000,6058,6392,6475,6733,6740],"themes":[21,23,31,39],"genres":[13,15,31,32],"dlcs":[19979,76239,75871],"first_release_date":1415923200000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[6,49,34,48,14,3,39],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1436832000000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Jul-14","y":2015,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1436832000000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Jul-14","y":2015,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1415923200000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Nov-14","y":2014,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1415923200000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Nov-14","y":2014,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1415923200000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Nov-14","y":2014,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1453766400000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Jan-26","y":2016,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1453766400000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Jan-26","y":2016,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"This War of Mine: The Little Ones","comment":"Other"},{"name":"TWoM","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gyicccdkbhsivub4vsw8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gyicccdkbhsivub4vsw8","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/avrls2nrttjlpdixv74q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"avrls2nrttjlpdixv74q","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hwqbhnldywm1bbbtdl7t.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hwqbhnldywm1bbbtdl7t","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ms0gzfdqkzxc5ywaxwrg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ms0gzfdqkzxc5ywaxwrg","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sfdfkkemj3ynyjarar4w.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sfdfkkemj3ynyjarar4w","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"The Survivor Launch Trailer","video_id":"YZrLyED0m4g"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j3byvgtjkk6scey7ugg1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j3byvgtjkk6scey7ugg1","width":756,"height":1080},"esrb":{"synopsis":"Platform: PlayStation 4, Xbox One","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\n\r\nIt contains: Multiple, motiveless killing -

When I finally picked it up, I just didn’t get that vibe.  The stories can be sad, and the lore you experience can be melancholy, but the game itself is still about overcoming challenges and hardship.  And I think that message is what made this game addicting for me.\n\nThe atmosphere and sound design are incredibly immersive.  There’s tension everywhere, and even a friendly knock on the door can be terrifying.  This is when you know a game has pulled you in and demonstrated just how helpless you are.  The art style portrays the hard times and difficult environment, but it is also so beautifully done.  It’s hard to not admire it sometimes, even when everyone is struggling.  The characters also have interesting back stories, and you even learn to care about some of them. Some.\n\nOne of my only complaints is that once I beat the game, I felt like I learned the “formula” needed to be successful in this game.  There were also only so many places to explore, and very little changed about them.  This meant you knew what to expect every play through.  This dropped the replayability a lot for me, and it also killed a bit of the magic I first had when I initially played.  \n\nMy other complaint is that I think ALL of the characters are too sensitive about the same things.  I can understand some not wanting to steal to survive, but it negatively affects almost EVERYONE.  For example, some replayability could come from treating situations differently.  Maybe I want to try stealing to survive, or defending myself with weapons while scavenging (meaning, I could potentially kill someone).  Well, I can’t, because every character will take each of those actions so negatively, they’ll most likely kill themselves if I play this way.  This sort of mechanic felt a bit shallow to me.  Maybe not shallow, but I felt like the devs definitely want you to play it their way.\n\nEven though I have those complaints, I cannot overstate how much I recommend this game.  It’s beautifully done, and there’s nothing else out there quite like it.  Trust me, I’ve checked when I needed to scratch that itch.  Thanks to the devs for a great game!\n","timestamp_created":1518842539,"timestamp_updated":1518842539,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.537037","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40379089","author":{"steamid":"76561198193324581","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":18,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1518242333},"language":"english","review":"good","timestamp_created":1519540478,"timestamp_updated":1519540478,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.563492","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40225265","author":{"steamid":"76561198039501194","num_games_owned":422,"num_reviews":66,"playtime_forever":5901,"playtime_last_two_weeks":155,"last_played":1519173364},"language":"english","review":"An amazing, dark, and daring game.

A very deep game that gets into a heart of not just one player.[/i]\n\nI was searching for a game like this. A game where your choices matter and where one mistake can actually ruin the whole game. \nThis war of mine is a game that shows the perspective of people, innocent people that sadly have to experience war. So you don't see the war through the eyes of a soldier, how many games show. You start in a shelter, destroyed shelter by shelling and looters. By time you try to make this shelter more comfortable for all the people that live in it. There are many different characters and each one of them has their own story. There are different sets of characters and everytime you play you unlock new stories basicaly, since you unlock more sets of characters that you need to take care of. Or you can even make your own set of characters. You need to scavenge, make difficult choices and survive. You can go through the war without killing a single person, or you can play agressively, it is just up to you. I really like how the game's atmosphere pulls you into the story and how it puts you into a role of a person that is responsible for lives of other people. When you let one of your characters die, you just feel so miserable. When one of your characters falls into depression or the character gets sick, you try to do as much as you can to keep them fine. It is often a big challange to keep everyone alive till the war ends.\nBut when you manage to, the feeling is amazing!\n\nThis game is worth its price, it is a great game, even though it may not be for everyone. Overall epic game with deep atmosphere and many possibilites. For this price, you get 15 hours of play time at the minimum which is obviously pretty great. 9/10","timestamp_created":1519125992,"timestamp_updated":1519125992,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.545455","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39903270","author":{"steamid":"76561198198924606","num_games_owned":77,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":24384,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1518154030},"language":"english","review":"Let me start off saying this is a great game concept wise and does have some great features.  But thier are soooo many issues that it has turned me off to the point it is barely playable without mods. Great game as far as atmosphere and the overall idea behind it.  But the numerous bugs and the fact that the base game is so damn easy to survive.  If you do hiccup somewhere all you have to do is leave and restart the day and boom all is fine.  Cheesy but hard to avoid knowing you can get back the character that died simply by restarting the day.  Also Katia is still completely broken as you can unrealistically clear out the entire inventory of any trader be trading back and forth since she gets a HUGE discount and after a few minutes of back and forth you can basically empty out the trader.  Also the game crashes often and after 70 days in when a character or characters just freeze and you cannot interract and have to watch them starve to death since they cannot move is a joke since this problem has been for years now just as the Katia problem.  This happens often with the kids especially.  Also charcters glitch and will say things that makes no sense. \n NPCs will talk as if other NPCs are there even when alone (\"Hit Him\", \"Don't let him get away!\", etc). I do actually still enjoy the game by using difficulty mods that make the game much harder.  Because it is just too easy once you understand you can take advantage of so many loopholes.  The garage has so much easy access suplies.  the Supermarket and Hospital will get you Rifles and Shotguns with many bullets right off the jump by simply stealth killing the baddies.  It is just too easy late game especially like once you are basically self suffficent with an alchohol and Tobacco empire as well as a garden and traps etc.  Just too many problems which is disappointing because the general concept is very cool. I wish the developers would address all of these issues I just don't get why they can't.   A shame because it is truly very close to being a great game despite the simply layout and controls due to decision making and environment.","timestamp_created":1517988285,"timestamp_updated":1517988285,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.546697","comment_count":"5","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39650190","author":{"steamid":"76561198223003540","num_games_owned":62,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":1949,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1517378937},"language":"english","review":"even i played this game once, i really want play again over and over again. this game never bored me. and this game just reminds me that war is more scary than all game and film i saw. the music nice and saving money coz really wanted the tri DLC 10/10 this game awsome.","timestamp_created":1517046664,"timestamp_updated":1517046664,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523810","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39773978","author":{"steamid":"76561198064813986","num_games_owned":137,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":4263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1518144054},"language":"english","review":"Such an amazing game, after several playthroughs and owning it for a couple years this game hasn't gotten old.

Jesus Christ I couldn't have done it fast enough. Simply starting this game and being greeted by its hauntingly beautiful soundtrack is utterly spellbinding.  \n\nDrawing inspiration from the Bosnian War and its numerous battles, The Siege of Sarajevo in particular, This War of Mine utilises real stories and events from survivors of the Bosnian War to paint a vivid picture. In This War of Mine you control a group of survivors that are thrust into an unknown warzone, the point of the anonymity aids the game in relaying the fact that a conflict like this can and will be happening somewhere in the world. This group must fight, scavenge and survive until the conflict is resolved, weapons and tools are rarity, food and water more so.  \n\nEvery decision you make, you make for the group, and if you wish for the pack to survive, you best make the right ones. Constantly hammering you with ACTUALLY impactful adaptions to the gameplay and ACTUALLY punishing you for stupid or \"necessary\" mistakes or judgements. Enter buildings at your own risk, steal from those less fortunate or outright kill others and become as mad as the world around you, the choice and freedom of your decisions will reverberate through the community and your other housemates however. \n\nThe soundtrack is as I've previously said, hauntingly beautiful, taking inspiration from games like the Metro series, it's sweeping and yet at times so focused on minor details. Such as the winds providing an almost breeze-like effect, the lone guitar providing something that can hook the player in and can feel solidarity to. Other times the music shifts to a much darker tone, leaving open to anxious thoughts and allowing panic and fear to enter your once resolute mind. In short, Piotr Musial has done a gorgeous job and provided something that could hold a flame to composers such as Alexy Omelchukand, Keiichi Okabe and Austin Wintory \n\nThe gameplay and UI are simplistic, taking away any unnecessary filler information that could distract you from completing your tasks. Your tasks for the day are easy; stay home, build and shore up whatever defences you can, maintain the wellbeing of your household and keep warm. Simple as. However, when night comes, so do the monsters who hide in plain sight. Opting to either keep all your occupants home and safe, or risking the night is a harsh but easy one, risking a bullet to the head certainly keeps the house fed after all. So, with whatever tools that can be found or made and hopefully some protection, the scavenger can get to work. This is where a majority of your thinking skills come in handy, figuring out who to hit. Do you go for the hospital where medicine and clean water are in surplus, but you're ultimately stealing from those far worse off than you, or do you steal from the elderly couple whose house has remained untouched, but your very presence strikes fear into their hearts. Especially when they catch you stealing from them.  Again, completely up to you, but for every ill deed there comes a reckoning. \n\nScrolling past some of the other user reviews it's easy to be disheartened or even scoff at seeing the fifth review calling it \"depressing\" or seeing some diva whine about the how emotionally scarred they are after playing this game. But the funny thing is, they're true, at least partially. This game IS depressing, it's heart wrenching, punishing and judging. But that's exactly the point. No longer are you John Generic, US Marine and world champion crayon eater who saves the day by shooting anything dressed in red and has the words EVIL ductaped to its head. You are a human being, flawed, complicated and up a very large creek called shit. This War of Mine isn't meant to be another story about John Generic saving the world, it's about you, and the choices you make to save the house that is your world.  \n\nThis is a sobering game. These events have happened, will happen and will continue to happen. War is an unending cycle, it's something humanity is good at and let's face it, people don't like to stop when they've realised their potential. However, instead of picking up the controller or opening up GTA: V to have some 11-year-old tell you about his sexual conquests whilst he blasts you from three kilometres away. Buy this game and attempt to live as a stable house whilst the ever-present fear of failure, madness and death breathe down your neck. Suffer, and witness what it's like to be one of people caught in John Generic's crossfire.  \n\nIf you're still uncertain but can put up with my \"essay\" I urge you to watch a man called DasBoSchitt play this game, not only does he convey everything one hopes to feel with this game but he does it in such a tasteful manner I'm utterly shocked at his subscriber count. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31R8lt-njtc&list=PLnXFQiKEVqUP9_tZAxlc9j0GKRdj3q7NU\n\nTLDR: PLAY THIS GAME.

I would highly recommend it to all people who like good games.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"http://de.ign.com/spacecom-pc/95403/review/review-zu-spacecom-strategie-kann-so-einfach-sein\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >IGN Deutschland</a></a><br><br>“Spacecom is simple, both graphically and mechanically—so simple it could almost be a board game.  And yet despite—or rather, because of—this unassuming exterior, there's a lot of depth for you to explore within a limited space. That's the kind of strategy I like! It's like playing an actual game of chess where each piece has a very defined set of rules versus a weird game of pseudo-chess where each pawn functions slightly differently and you won't really understand the point of half of them until you're fifty hours in.  We like to say &quot;Graphics don't matter! Graphics don't matter!&quot; Well, here's your proof. Just bring your imagination to the table, and there's a deeply satisfying strategy game waiting for you.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2684902/spacecom-review-a-rousing-game-of-strategy-between-a-bunch-of-triangles.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PC World</a></a><br><br>“Spacecom is exactly what I like.

\"Pixel\" Amaya. It was released in 2014 for PC and iOS and is the first major project of Pixel since Cave Story in 2004. The game lays a heavy emphasis on shooting and got positive reviews on both platforms. A short, free demo titled Pink Hour has been available since a month before the full game's release.\nIn Kero Blaster, the player controls a frog working for Cat & Frog, a teleporter company. Armed with a peashooter, he has to clean the teleporters of strange black monsters. The player has to work their way through a series of linear stages, by means of running, gunning and jumping.

The last update by the devs (2015) was adding a workshop whcih allowed users to upload maps they created but the map editor was third party software + it's hard to undrerstand (for me atleast). In my opinion is good at the start, the tutorial is very helpful and it made sense and it has a story that the game completely abandons after the tutorial is done. There is one mission called 'lonely alley' clearly it was a mission the devs put in to be mysterious and it had no uses, just a door that blocked off the 'alley' that you couldn't open. I opened it with some trusty C4 (unanticipated by the devs obviously) and of course, nothing. An incomplete mission. Suprisingly the stealth is pretty good if you're a micromanager. The proggresion is fairly balanced but you'll find yourself repeating missions to get money for new gear/ammo/crew which gets tiresome. Graphics for this game are nice, I like the art style and the shadows look really good. The final mission (SPOILERS if u even care which i wouldn't) is stealing form Fort Knox, if robbing Fort Knox was THIS easy I'd know where to start and end my criminal career. Some weapons you can only acquire from certain missions (they don't respawn if you do the mission again) aren't purchasable from the market, so say you drop some sweet knuckle dusters you found in the toture room of the police station to pick up some cash instead and escape. SAY BYE BYE TO THE KNUCKLE DUSTERS. Your crew also feel like empty mules to carry out your commands, no speech (excpet for the toutorial, they chat like birds in the morning). I would've reccomended this game if they actually put time into the map editor and allowed the players to express their creative potenial and show the world, it's saved so many games in the past and I don't understand if they were willing to stop making agame without the likelyhood of people playing beyond the base missions. It pains me that a game with such pontential has to get neglected by the devs. Another thing, some guns are only acquirable by hiring crew with said gun, for exaple I wanted a silenced pistol so I could make the guards not detect me killing their comrades, I'd have to hire a new crew member with a silenced pistol to get it.(another thing you can't purchase from the black market). But I must say the black market and the ordering system is pretty good, you go on a phone order it, they drop off a box, destroy the box and you get what you ordered. The safehouse also had SO much potenital but with about 10 of the rooms only 4 of them actually have things of intrest (yes, they have NOTHING in them, not even a chair or a window).","timestamp_created":1512907973,"timestamp_updated":1512907973,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497925","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39117614","author":{"steamid":"76561198064357130","num_games_owned":165,"num_reviews":31,"playtime_forever":253,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1515622146},"language":"english","review":"Crashes a lot, other than that, worth like 2 $ (get it on sale or dont get it at all, 100 copies isnt worth 20$)","timestamp_created":1515244611,"timestamp_updated":1515244611,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.480384","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"37834640","author":{"steamid":"76561198131512178","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":38,"playtime_forever":2396,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1509801781},"language":"english","review":"VEEEEERRRRYYYY FUN GAME","timestamp_created":1511825612,"timestamp_updated":1511825612,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.447227","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}]},"appDetails":{"type":"game","name":"The Masterplan","steam_appid":313080,"required_age":"16","is_free":false,"dlc":[376320],"detailed_description":"The Masterplan is an award-winning tactical squad-based heist game set in 1970s.

Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure (developed under the working title Project Fedora) is the upcoming sixth game in the Tex Murphy series of detective adventure games, developed by Big Finish Games and published by Atlus. Like the previous three games, it will tell much of its story through live-action full-motion video sequences, and feature freely explorable 3D environments during gameplay.","storyline":"Tex Murphy wakes up - disoriented and head pounding - on the fire escape outside his office atop the Ritz Hotel. Another typical morning for the last of the old-school detectives. Except it isn't. What starts out as the worst hangover in history becomes a baffling nightmare: something - or someone - has erased Tex's memory of the past seven years. Motivated by lost love, revenge and the world's strongest coffee blend, Tex must retrace his own steps into a maze of unsolved murders, hidden agendas and lost technologies of Nikola Tesla. Only by solving the mysteries of his past can Tex hope to regain his memory in time to restore what's been lost and stop a terrifying future.","collection":813,"hypes":3,"rating":61.635409970922,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":68.5,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":65.067704985461,"total_rating_count":7,"rating_count":4,"games":[17159,5601,536,1906,17354,3035,11270,9727,21599,9730],"tags":[18,20,27,268435487,268435488,536870979,536870981,536871041,536871262,536871338,536871400,536871487,536871752,536871878,536872419,536872435,536872581,536872647,536872793,536873352,536875006,536875046,536875060,536875095,536875098,536875111,536875199,536875242,536875244,536875249,536875257,536875271,536875310,536875315,536875325,536875326,536875330,536875340,536875344,536875358,536875362,536875426,536875488,536875492,536875502,536875504,536875511,536875513,536875523,536875524,536875525,536875533,536875546,536875547,536875565,536875639,536875741,536875745,536875747,536875792,536875804,536875808,536875809,536875869,536876025,536876028,536876109,536876125,536876126,536876130,536876185,536876188,536876302,536876391,536876414,536876573,536876654,536876663,536876674,536876833,536876851,536877332,536877341,536877352,536877371,536877373,536877393,536877578,536877704,536877740,536877907,536877964,536877992,536878397,1073741825],"developers":[2464],"publishers":[818],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[67,69,129,350,426,488,575,840,966,1507,1523,1669,1735,1881,2440,4094,4134,4148,4183,4186,4199,4287,4330,4332,4337,4345,4359,4398,4403,4413,4414,4418,4428,4432,4446,4450,4514,4576,4580,4590,4592,4599,4601,4611,4612,4613,4621,4634,4635,4653,4727,4829,4833,4835,4880,4892,4896,4897,4957,5113,5116,5197,5213,5214,5218,5273,5276,5390,5479,5502,5661,5742,5751,5762,5921,5939,6420,6429,6440,6459,6461,6481,6666,6792,6828,6995,7052,7080,7485],"themes":[18,20,27],"genres":[31,32],"first_release_date":1399507200000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1399507200000,"region":8,"human":"2014-May-08","y":2014,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1399507200000,"region":8,"human":"2014-May-08","y":2014,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Tex Murphy -

is an incredible physics-based action puzzler. It's what I imagine you'd get if you crossed the Ecco the Dolphin game, with the World of Goo game with the Bladerunner movie, in terms of its combination of gameplay and atmosphere.\n\nI was going to write a review earlier when I was at level 4, but I was reading some negative reviews saying it got too hard at later points, so I decided to finish all 7 levels to be thorough. I can honestly say the challenge level was not excessive at any point. Yes there were a handful of points that I was stuck on for a while, but isn't challenge part of the reason you play games? It is for me anyway. To be honest, I feel ripped off if nothing stumps me in a whole game. And I would say all of those moments were followed by an \"Ohhh\" revelation, usually me approaching the problem in a fundamentally wrong way, or not paying close enough attention to the mechanics of the movement.\n\nIt's a joy to \"learn to walk\" in this game. The resolution between figuring out the puzzle and making your organism carry your solution out is very satisfying -- SO many \"Ohhh\" moments! The visuals are flawless as is the soundtrack, the perfect ether to immerse you in the practical aspect of the mechanics and puzzles. I also feel like a 2nd play-through to 100% all the level collectibles/achievements would be just as fun (now I just need life to give me unlimited free time kthx... *cry*).\n\nI don't get the time to play games often, but picking this game for the holidays was a great decision!\n\nIf you do play it, don't give up! Stay to experience the AMAZING CLIMAX :)\n\nIf you'd like a copy, I'll be giving away 5 free copies to the first 5 people who reply to this review!  Simply reply with \"Mushrooms are delicious!\" (or something expressing that you'd like to play the game), and I will friend you and gift it to you.

I feel bad because it is such an original concept and really is a good puzzle game... but it is so hard and very, very frustrating especially on the last 2-3 chapters.\n\nIn the game, you control an amobea / blob like creature.  You move by erasing part of yourself, which causes the remaining leftovers to grow in a somewhat random fashion.  Your creature can take on almost any shape, but getting how you want is not always so easy.  The goal of the game is to just reach the end of each chapter, of which there are 7.  Each level also ends with a boss, he being just another puzzle but where you need to somehow destroy him.  Things start out simple with you just needing to reach up to grab things and cross empty spaces.  By the end you will be pushing buttons, riding rockets, pushing balls and racing to make a bridge for them and many other complicated things.\n\nThis is all great but the levels are simply too long and many of the puzzles are too fiddly.  Since you grow in a somewhat random fashion, you can know what you want to do and still fail miserably at making your creature do it.  A few of the puzzles in particular will take the average player 10 to 20 attempts to complete them (you riding a rocket across a pool of acid for example).  If these difficult puzzles would have been reduced and the chapters been reduced in length, the game would have been fun and I would have recommended this.  Most players simply won't have the patience to get through to the end of the game, I almost gave up on it myself.  Those with lots of patience might want to try it out though if the concept looks intriguing, others should pass.","timestamp_created":1514600608,"timestamp_updated":1514600608,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474138","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}]},"appDetails":{"type":"game","name":"Mushroom 11","steam_appid":243160,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"dlc":[408070],"detailed_description":"<img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/243160/extras/m11_l2_6.png?t=1478022589\" >      <img src=\"http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/243160/extras/m11_5.3.png?t=1478022589\" ><br><strong>Delete it and it will grow.</strong><br>Mold an amorphous organism into any shape by pruning its cells.

action role-playing game developed by Obsidian Entertainment and published by Square Enix for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows.[5] Chris Taylor, the original creator of Dungeon Siege, served as an advisor during the development of the game. It is the third game in the series not to be developed by Gas Powered Games, (after Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna by Mad Doc Software and Dungeon Siege: Throne of Agony by SuperVillain Studios) and the first to be published by Square Enix after it acquired the complete ownership of the Dungeon Siege franchise. It was released on June 17, 2011. (wiki, 2014)","storyline":"The game returns to the Kingdom of Ehb, which already featured as the setting of the first (but not second) game. Roughly 150 years after the events of Dungeon Siege, the 10th Legion, who provided stability and protection for the kingdom for 400 years, has almost completely been wiped out. 30 years before the game's setting, Jeyne Kassynder rallied the people of eastern Ehb and the Azunite Church against the Legion who she blamed for the death of the king (her father). Following a long and brutal campaign, she managed to kill the entire remnant of the Legion in a battle in the Rukkenvahl Forest and the royalist army of young Queen Roslyn has been driven deep into the mines of Glitterdelve, losing almost all of their power.

Players complete quests and use swords, ranged weapons, and magic spells to kill both human and supernatural enemies (e.g., skeletons, goblins, demons, giant wolves). Battles include hack-and-slash combat, highlighted by cries of pain and brief puffs of blood. During the course of the game, players can elect to spare or kill certain boss characters; if players choose the latter, the boss is depicted in a small pool of blood. Some female characters are depicted in the game wearing low-cut outfits that reveal moderate amounts of cleavage; the dialogue also contains some suggestive references (e.g., 'Your mother seduced Montbarron?' and 'We will seduce a foreign man, but only if he is strong . . . clever . . . handsome.'). The words 'whore,' 'damn,' and 'bastard' can be heard in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE.","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/39160"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.dungeonsiege.com/"}],"external":{"steam":"39160"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":9,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},"humbleBundle":{"bundle":"dungeonsiege3_storefront","custom_download_page_box_html":"","downloads":[],"human_name":"Dungeon Siege III","icon":null,"library_family_name":null,"machine_name":"dungeonsiege3","payee":{"human_name":"SQUARE ENIX","machine_name":"squareenix"},"url":"http://www.square-enix.com/"},"steam":{"reviews":{"success":1,"query_summary":{"num_reviews":4,"review_score":5,"review_score_desc":"Mixed","total_positive":344,"total_negative":269,"total_reviews":613},"reviews":[{"recommendationid":"39687762","author":{"steamid":"76561197964773915","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":42,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1517000726},"language":"english","review":"If you are thinking of buying this hoping it would be a modern version of Dungeon Siege 1 or 2, please do not.  It is virtually NOTHING like the first 2 in the series and almost every aspect of the game is miserable.  The camera angles(2) are both absolutely terrible.  The controls feel like you are trying to use a console controller on a game that was designed for mouse and keyboard... even when using a mouse and keyboard.  The \"stats\" have little to know clear meaning or explaination... that being said it's impossible to know what gear is better.  The maps are VERY linear, magnified by the minimap which is basically a straight line that you follow.  Little to no customization of your characater relative to the previous versions of the game.\n\nLong story short, do NOT buy this game, or the 3-game package.","timestamp_created":1517160423,"timestamp_updated":1517160423,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588498","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39785834","author":{"steamid":"76561197987692749","num_games_owned":283,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":1037,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1361865600},"language":"english","review":"So much promise of a great game, yet so much ruined.","timestamp_created":1517559664,"timestamp_updated":1517559664,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503511","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39687478","author":{"steamid":"76561198014621099","num_games_owned":259,"num_reviews":21,"playtime_forever":1809,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1517159034},"language":"english","review":"Wow!

The game is literally magnificent. I was one of the unlucky people who although was born in 90s, didn't have the chance to play a single Legend of Zelda game. This game looks and feels like one Zelda games but in with its own theme and world. I highly recommend this game to kids and adults as well. Really relaxing and good gameplay with joyful musics. I own it both on mobile and PC now but finished it on PC. I'm so happy to hear that there is a sequel coming up and hopefully a third one will also be made. \nHowever I have one tiny complaint. The fishing mechanics are really stale and not fun in my opinion. I had really hard time catching some of the fishes but finding them was even harder. Nonetheless, I went through the trouble and 100% this game. Don't miss this game out.

The game features ridiculous violence, pixel art graphics and a fully destructible Vietnam setting. While masquerading as a run ‘n gun in the vein of Metal Slug, Broforce’s reactive environment encourages tactical play. Each bro out of the 13 the game currently features has distinctive overpowered attacks and special abilities, and mastering them all is one of Broforce’s core pleasures. Death is instant and can be surprising, but this is balanced by the incompetence of the enemy. Explosions are plentiful and very often result in chaotic chain reactions, but this shouldn’t discourage you from permanently holding down your trigger finger. Yelling “‘Murica!” while you do so is optional. \nBroforce is best played co-operatively, two to four players (though single player is an option). It can be played both on keyboard and on XBox controllers. \nVehicular action sequences, dinosaurs, aliens and epic Contra-inspired boss fights, deathmatch arenas with leaderboards and rankings, a level editor, the ability to challenge friends and share custom levels, a customizable Brofort with unlockable rooms and much more to come in the full game. The only thing left to say is: brace your loins.","hypes":1,"rating":79.8438331978668,"popularity":3,"aggregated_rating":71.625,"aggregated_rating_count":9,"total_rating":75.7344165989334,"total_rating_count":63,"rating_count":54,"games":[6732,19448,7344,55752,7202,19174,25300,27314,74161,72373],"tags":[1,18,27,268435461,268435464,268435487,268435488,536870913,536870933,536871029,536871139,536871262,536871325,536871572,536871707,536871882,536871937,536872054,536872285,536872617,536872695,536872961,536873405,536874706,536874743,536874813,536875046,536875060,536875095,536875171,536875229,536875358,536875420,536875456,536875484,536875611,536875638,536875689,536875708,536875792,536875901,536876028,536876228,536876239,536876261,536876291,536876365,536876377,536876415,536876544,536876564,536876572,536876634,536876684,536876685,536876686,536876687,1073741828],"developers":[2345,2603],"publishers":[634],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[1,21,117,227,350,413,660,795,970,1025,1142,1373,1705,1783,2049,2493,3794,3831,3901,4134,4148,4183,4259,4317,4446,4508,4544,4572,4699,4726,4777,4796,4880,4989,5116,5316,5327,5349,5379,5453,5465,5503,5632,5652,5660,5722,5772,5773,5774,5775],"themes":[1,18,27],"genres":[5,8,31,32],"standalone_expansions":[9786],"first_release_date":1444867200000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[45,6,92,14,48,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1456790400000,"region":1,"human":"2016-Mar-01","y":2016,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1456790400000,"region":2,"human":"2016-Mar-01","y":2016,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1456790400000,"region":2,"human":"2016-Mar-01","y":2016,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1456790400000,"human":"2016-Mar-01","y":2016,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1444867200000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Oct-15","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1444867200000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Oct-15","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1444867200000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Oct-15","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":92,"date":1444867200000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Oct-15","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1456790400000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Mar-01","y":2016,"m":3}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xgesjlkifyadbss6oldk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xgesjlkifyadbss6oldk","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rizotowvcpaedw475sjl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rizotowvcpaedw475sjl","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qxogiririvdsdmbdxybm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qxogiririvdsdmbdxybm","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/owys7j1r7oaepz7sh9jf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"owys7j1r7oaepz7sh9jf","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/v9aujrsnnmupk0jnxrpq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"v9aujrsnnmupk0jnxrpq","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay

It's a blast. For me, it is a good challenge, but trying different approaches always pays off. Sometimes sneaky, sometimes rushing, and sometimes super careful. And, each retry uses totally random BROS, so you have to play with what you are dealt. It's such a good idea, because each BROS has totally different weapons and playstyles. It constantly keeps you on your toes.\nThe level designs are very clever, too. It is never boring, with deformable terrain, and dynamic map elements. Based on how I approach the level, I might find myself trying to dig up through a mountain, or making flying jumps into the air praying to see the ground when I land. Just like the movie Team America, this game delivers lots of laughs and lots of action, but just like that movie, you are only going to enjoy this in small doses. Thankfully, it's easy to pick up and come back to later.","timestamp_created":1516936522,"timestamp_updated":1518661600,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.656250","comment_count":"1","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40162686","author":{"steamid":"76561198256649566","num_games_owned":23,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":1304,"playtime_last_two_weeks":172,"last_played":1518718699},"language":"english","review":"===[ ❤ Audience: ]===\n☐ Kids\n☑ Everyone\n☐ Casual players\n☐ Pro players\n☐ Tryhard players\n\n===[ ☼ Graphics: ]===\n☐ Potato\n☐ Really bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ OK\n☐ Good\n☐ Beautiful\n☑ Masterpiece (IMHO, I love this kind of 8bit)\n\n===[ $ Price/quality: ]===\n☐ Full price\n☑ Wait for sale\n☐ Average\n☐ Refund it if you can\n☐ Don't do it\n\n===[ ☣ Requirments: ]===\n☑ 90' PC\n☐ Minimum\n☐ Medium\n☐ Fast\n☐ High end\n☐ NASA computer\n\n===[ ☼ Difficulty: ]===\n☐ You just need 2 arms\n☑ Ez\n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Hard (first few hours)\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n\n===[ ۞ Game time/length ]===\n☐ Really short ( 0 - 2 hours)\n☑ Short ( 2 - 8 hours)\n☐ Few hours ( 8 - 12 hours)\n☐ Long ( 12+ hours)\n☐ Endless\n\n===[ ♬ Story] ===\n☐ It doesn't have\n☐ Still better than Twilight\n☐ Average\n☑ Good\n☐ Fantastic\n\n===[ § Bugs ]===\n☐ Game itself is one big BUG\n☐ Bugs destroying the game\n☐ Lot of bugs\n☐ Few Bugs\n☐ You can use them for speedrun\n☑ Nothing\n\n===[ ✦ Others: ]===\nMultiplayer: YES\nSingleplayer: YES\n\n","timestamp_created":1518885268,"timestamp_updated":1518885268,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":10,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.641176","comment_count":"2","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39837368","author":{"steamid":"76561197992505500","num_games_owned":513,"num_reviews":50,"playtime_forever":357,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1517734950},"language":"english","review":"Bringing freedom to terrorists, aliens and undead in the most american way possible","timestamp_created":1517734437,"timestamp_updated":1517734437,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":8,"votes_funny":6,"weighted_vote_score":"0.618483","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39942090","author":{"steamid":"76561198353225296","num_games_owned":38,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":814,"playtime_last_two_weeks":12,"last_played":1518896903},"language":"english","review":"lots of explosions, lots ptsd, lots of bullets, lots guns + many action \n10/10","timestamp_created":1518134307,"timestamp_updated":1518134307,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.503106","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39805255","author":{"steamid":"76561198121486006","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":2838,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1517636136},"language":"english","review":"topster","timestamp_created":1517626353,"timestamp_updated":1517626353,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543726","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39930847","author":{"steamid":"76561198065275459","num_games_owned":101,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":105,"playtime_last_two_weeks":21,"last_played":1519537342},"language":"english","review":"-Gibs\n-Action\n-Iconic characters\n-2D mayhem \n-Multiplayer \n\n11/10 would play again","timestamp_created":1518099573,"timestamp_updated":1518099573,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.000000","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39974730","author":{"steamid":"76561198092837314","num_games_owned":58,"num_reviews":25,"playtime_forever":1220,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1516552213},"language":"english","review":"It is America's most patrotic indie platform game you can find in steam!

I found Spacecom even more exciting and involving than most triple-A games recently. I would highly recommend it to all people who like good games.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"http://de.ign.com/spacecom-pc/95403/review/review-zu-spacecom-strategie-kann-so-einfach-sein\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >IGN Deutschland</a></a><br><br>“Spacecom is simple, both graphically and mechanically—so simple it could almost be a board game.  And yet despite—or rather, because of—this unassuming exterior, there's a lot of depth for you to explore within a limited space. That's the kind of strategy I like! It's like playing an actual game of chess where each piece has a very defined set of rules versus a weird game of pseudo-chess where each pawn functions slightly differently and you won't really understand the point of half of them until you're fifty hours in.  We like to say &quot;Graphics don't matter! Graphics don't matter!&quot; Well, here's your proof. Just bring your imagination to the table, and there's a deeply satisfying strategy game waiting for you.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2684902/spacecom-review-a-rousing-game-of-strategy-between-a-bunch-of-triangles.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PC World</a></a><br><br>“Spacecom is exactly what I like.

Just like Cortex Command, Planetoid Pioneers has the same key issues. Both games have a really awesome take on physics and pixel by pixel destruction. The core of both games is amazing... but that's just it. The games are just good core concepts. They're like the best building foundations you've ever seen, but they have shacks made of rotting wood on top. Both games are just empty sandboxes. Sandboxes which don't even run particularly well on any computer. You notice I keep using comparisons between both games because they're nearly the same. \n\nThis game took great steps in its art style, music and physics but took 10 steps back everywhere else. There is NOTHING after the main \"game\". You spend a few hours playing through what was marketed as the game's story. You're a really old guy who crashes on a planet and has to get enough tech to build a new ship. This isn't like Terraria where the world is random and massive, no. It's all preset and static every time you play; It's just one world. There is literally nothing else in terms of story or progression, it just ends there. After completing \"Primeoid\" (the \"main game\"), you gain access to more worlds. Great! More story right!? WRONG. They're practically mini-games or tech demos showing what CAN be done with the engine and editor.\n\nThese planetoids take merely minutes to complete each. They include...\n\n-A gamemode about \"catching\" flying aliens with a grappling hook and pulling them back to the mission start.\n\n-An easier variant of that exact same gamemode mentioned above.\n\n-A racing mode which isn't much of a race when you can't pass the AI. You can win just by letting the AI kill you so you spawn in front of them on each checkpoint, almost ensuring 1st place.\n\n-An \"arena\" where you just watch workshop created creatures fight.\n\n-A deathmatch mode which plays like a sad and broken Duck Game.\n\n-Another tiny planet to complete like the main Primeoid.\n\n-A small planet with seemingly no objective or way to complete it.\n\n-A blank world for you to make your own scenario with the editor.\n\n-A wave defense planet\n\n-Lastly who knows, it's a miracle I remembered 9/10.\n\nThis game is another Cortex Command but even more limited and boring. You can't destroy the map, only entities. You can't customize anything, you're just told to make more stuff in the creator yourself by the devs. The final insult is that there's no fun here. Cortex Command you could have mindless fun watching the giant meat grinder of a war, people dying from outside elements, and it had some tactics if you tried. Planetoid Pioneers is just a straight static line. Every time you play the main game you just get bored and sad thinking of what the game COULD have been. With no online multiplayer there really is no reason to play. I'm not the tech-savvy person who wants to spend an hour drawing and LUA scripting my own stuff to enjoy a sandbox. They should have had this ready...\n\nIf that's not enough, I'll go on about the development cycle for this game and what I think is wrong here.\n\nData Realms wanted to do something new with Early Access games by letting players have access to the same editors to help make content before the games release. Now bluntly you think, \"Wow! That's kind of cool and nice of them.\" Then you realise that they just wanted to have people do their work for them. They have no clue what their niche fan base wants. Ultimately the game's current setup reflects that, with the short \"story\" and the 10 minigames. \n\nThey not only changed their Early Access in this sense, but they voided the purpose of Early Access entirely. They went dead silent for a good year + before the game's release. During this time, they were selling build 4 which is ancient. They had been updating the game left and right for a year without letting the player base see and help them improve. They come out of nowhere telling us, \"Tah-dah! Here's a fully finished game!\" Clearly, it's not. If people didn't notice, half the gamemodes have place holder descriptions marked- \"TO DO\" as a reminder among the devs.\n\nCortex command also did this; not with the whole Early Access issue, but falling off a cliff with it's development. They made the game 64bit in 2016 and doubled the FPS for a game that existed before \"Early Access\" was a thing on Steam. Even for that game they did the whole mini-game thing but it kind of worked because of the raw gameplay. The raw gameplay of Planetoid Pioneers DOES NOT carry it enough to be fun.\n\nKeep in mind, this is the same team that has massive trust issues with the Steam community because of Cortex Command. They have Data himself defend the game in awkward videos on both store pages. They respond to every negative review and try to plead and scrap over each point with the author to make it positive. They just have bad PR overall. All advertising and events for this game are from years ago and honestly not a lot has changed comparing gameplay and entities then to now. It even looked empty and boring back then. To promote the game Data just streamed auto-fight bot matches on twitch with 0-2 people watching for days leading up to release. There is no charisma or passion here.\n\nThe final point, what they can do to fix it... Honestly, I'm not sure. I think it is a bad idea to let Data run everything 100% the way he wants. I mean no disrespect what so ever, and I think he's done well for a small team. I even love his work deep down, there's nothing like it. The big elephant in the room is management ultimately. He can't take the top 10 jobs in each project like he does. There's no one telling him what he should or shouldn't do like a producer or someone from a marketing team. They clearly don't plan ahead, tons of game changing updates were just added the last 3 days before launch according to their discord \"updates\" channel. If Data Realms wants to be successful, which I belive they can... They need to take a step back and develop concepts into full games from a gamer's perspective, not the lead designer, producer, marketing agent, and parent of their own game.\n\nUnfortunately, this was a miss. Cortex Command is a better game despite being from a totally different era in gaming.","timestamp_created":1518140274,"timestamp_updated":1518159694,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":505,"votes_funny":4,"weighted_vote_score":"0.889396","comment_count":"155","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1518742600,"developer_response":"I've had several versions of responses up here, and after reconsidering (again), I've decided to replace all that and focus on the facts [i]only[/i]:\n\n[h1]\"Both Cortex Command and Planetoid Pioneers are nearly the same\"[/h1]\nThe entire game designs, engines, and teams behind them are almost totally different.

Even though the planetoid you are on seems small, there is tons of stuff hidden throughout and you can explore whichever path you feel like, provided you find a way there.\nThere are lots of different types of equipment to find and scan, which you can replicate on the fly with your matter printer if you have the necessary resources. Those range from lots of different weapons and explosives to grappling hooks, jet packs, vehicles, building constructs and other sort of equipment which have to be used to face the challenge of going from A to B.\n\nAnd the whole experience is just a ballpit of fun!\n\nI know of the other game they made - Cortex Command - which features a similiar strange style of movement and physic simulation ... but whate made CC frustrating (I only played a very early version many years ago) is fun in PP.\n\nAlso, there is a mighty editor for community content inside, in case the numerous planetoids are not enough - which present not only different levels but also wildly different game modes like PvP, horde mode, Racing and solo adventures.\n\nHowever, it is also quite obvious that the game is not quite ready for a full release - placeholder text, the level editor is directly usuable in the main game, no graphic settings, tanking framerates, long loading times (especially the very first start), wonky full screen mode ... I expect this from early access titles and not from release versions.\n\nNevertheless, I had an absolute blast in my first 11 hours despite all this and that's saying something.\n\nRecommended!","timestamp_created":1518300754,"timestamp_updated":1518300754,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.499708","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false,"timestamp_dev_responded":1518316884,"developer_response":"Aroddo, thank you so much for letting us know we are on the right track, and what we have to focus on right now - we just put live a nice update with lots of fixes from the first wave of feedback and observed problems.

Both this game and cortex command weigh heavily on community modding to provide content, while the developer provides the engine and tools for that content to made easily and enjoyed. This worked great for cortex command despite its many flaws, it works well for this game too. Core gameplay content made by the developers is an enjoyable 7-8 hour survival mission on a large planetoid, which is honestly enough on its own for a 15$ game. But the game has more content beyond that, not much right now, just a few minigames and a small touch of community content, but I am certain that with time it will grow just like cortex command.\n\nThe auto-injected workshop feature is actually very cool, and the versus mode is really fun because of it. Who knows what weapon my friends and I will have to learn on the fly how to use in order to win. Just like cortex command the game draws its fun from the pure hectic nature of its gameplay, and its amazing.\n\nTL:DR The game is very fun as is and offers a campaign which is worth the money in my opinion, and also shows great promise for more content created by the community and the developers both.","timestamp_created":1518380941,"timestamp_updated":1518380941,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.498629","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39848923","author":{"steamid":"76561198059818734","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1499,"playtime_last_two_weeks":124,"last_played":1518992947},"language":"english","review":"A really fun game.

The problem is the latter inspiration. The first four bosses you fight are nice and close together so if you get tired of trying to fight one you can just run over to the next and give that one a shot and eventually when you beat those four the next section opens up. This is where we run into problems. The second part of the game is a large expansive map more akin to a LoZ game where there is a substantial amount of distance between the boss locations, and no means of quickly traveling between them. \n\nSo now if you get tired of one boss and want to give another a shot, you have to travel back to where you were and then roam around looking for a new boss to fight in a large area with NO map to guide you along.\n\nThis got very tiring very quickly.","timestamp_created":1518661700,"timestamp_updated":1518661700,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523810","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40153522","author":{"steamid":"76561198291182785","num_games_owned":110,"num_reviews":36,"playtime_forever":319,"playtime_last_two_weeks":319,"last_played":1518867702},"language":"english","review":"So, this is the game people were saying difficult, \n19 bosses 4 hrs 45 mins 255 death, in other word i hate [b]Titan Souls[/b], but it's a good suggestion for people who want to experience something close to Dark Souls, good luck","timestamp_created":1518866247,"timestamp_updated":1518866247,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.522472","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39898910","author":{"steamid":"76561198277792271","num_games_owned":123,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":9,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1515712326},"language":"english","review":"Game play - Fun,Like dark soul.\nGraphic - Hey if you like pixel you like this just saying.\nPrice - Better buy it on sale.\n\nThis game is very fun if you are skillful, for you only have one arrow and \"1 shot\".Smart concept almost if its shadow of the colossus but instead its on a budget cut.Hey for the price in which i got it its worth it.However, I did not proclaim i ever finish the game - Cause I SUCCCCCCK.I would like to see this game combine with the survival aspect of DST then i think we'll see some pretty sick game which i still gonna be sh** at.\n","timestamp_created":1517964521,"timestamp_updated":1517964521,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.502058","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40078307","author":{"steamid":"76561198165603408","num_games_owned":37,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":286,"playtime_last_two_weeks":270,"last_played":1518784927},"language":"english","review":"Amazing game. Nice pixel art. Thrilling bosses.\n\nHowever having to walk to the boss area every time you die is just unbearable. I liked the game a lot, but because of that I can't stand playing it for more than 30 min straight. Why can't the player just respawn where he just died ? It's not like there's something to be done to get there other than simply walking and seeing the same scenario over and over. Sometimes a boss can kill me in less than 10 sec and I too can one shot bosses sometimes in few seconds, so I definitely spend more time walking than really fighting against the bosses in this game.\n\nIt's not like I'm complaing about the essence of the game or something that would change it entirely.

Help Manny untangle himself from a conspiracy that threatens his very salvation. \n \nOne of the most acclaimed adventure games of all time is now back, better than ever. Grim Fandango's epic story of four years in the life (or death) of Manny Calavera, travel agent to the dead, has been remastered to look, sound, and control even better than when it won GameSpot's Game of the Year award upon its original launch.

It is one of the best and most beloved Lucasarts titles, as well as one of the last adventure games the company developed. Grim Fandango's film noir story, reminiscent in tone to noire classics such as The Maltese Falcon, is peppered with dark humor and superbly written. Combined with the game's aztec and art deco inspired visual design, and latin and jazz influenced musical score, it created a truly unique and exceptional atmosphere compared to other adventure titles of the 90's.\n\nPROS\n+ Wonderful and unique atmosphere and visual design\n+ Dark, film noir narrative, often heartfelt, with plenty of witty and charming humor\n+ Good length for an adventure game, and satisfying to play to its conclusion\n+ Superb writing, dialogue and narrative still hold up for the most part, marred by a couple cringy lines\n+ Excellent voice acting\n+ Soundtrack is one of the best in the adventure genre. Evocative and beautiful, it perfectly fits the atmosphere and has been totally remastered using a live orchestra\n+ Improved controls - use a mouse, controller, or the original keyboard only tank controls (there is even an achievement for playing through it the way it was originally designed)\n+ Runs well on PC, as it should, did not encounter any bugs\n+ Improved aspect ratio, now able to choose 16:9 stretched, or the original 4:3\n+ Higher resolution character and 3d models\n+ Improved real-time lighting and shadows\n+ Enhanced cutscenes, movies look good considering the age of this game\n+ Developer commentary added, can be funny at times\n+ Achievements added\n\nCONS:\n- Prerendered backgrounds are unfortunately not remastered, look no different to the original\n- Dialogue has not been enhanced or improved, and some static can be heard in a few lines\n- Ability to switch between original and remastered mode is nothing but a curiosity, redundant, and not worth playing the game that way\n- Outdated and often illogical puzzle design\n- The archaic gameplay may be frustrating to some\n\nGrim Fandango Remastered can not, if we are being honest with ourselves, be called a complete remaster. Had the backgrounds been completely redone, or the dialogue cleaned up in a few places, this would be a different story. As it is, the remaster feels more like a touch-up of a beloved classic, albeit a damn good one. It stays faithful to the original - the humor still works, the strength of the original voice acting still shines, the game is still steeped in that lovely film noir atmosphere and is a blast to replay for someone who grew up in that golden age, the 90's. Despite the few flaws this remaster has, it is still the best way to experience the high point of a gaming era which has, sadly, long gone by. Get it on sale, or for full price if you're an old school fan, worth it for the nostalgia alone.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 8/10","timestamp_created":1516933524,"timestamp_updated":1517317567,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.509804","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39693682","author":{"steamid":"76561198237132692","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":16,"playtime_forever":1028,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1454227839},"language":"english","review":"Highly  reccomended, as stated it's a point & click classic that was made by the gaming comedy legend Double Fine.\nYou're a skeleton agent in the corrupt purgatory in a buisness that sells transportation tickets to get to other layers of the underworld. Your character got jealous that only his partner gets premium users (practically saints) so he steals a job from him and goes off to harvest the newly dead, and this little jealousy leads you down to the ends of the world through fire beavers to gigant pure gold statues of cats with plenty of jokes along the way.","timestamp_created":1517177148,"timestamp_updated":1517177148,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523810","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40203770","author":{"steamid":"76561198353368610","num_games_owned":9,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1496,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1516470553},"language":"english","review":"Grim Fandango was my first point-and-click adventure game, and it certainly won't be my last. This is a great introduction to the genre, as it can easily be played without a walkthrough and isn't . The characters aren't dried-out and saturated, even the antagonists, and have interesting interactions with one another.

It is clear that the programming was devised to force constant replays of the game.

Deemed the bad reviews to be from people not that ambitioned, strategicaly only average and frustrated by difficulty only.\n\nIn hindsight, the game does no provide enough content to justify the price. Unlocked nearly everything after a few hours of gameplay, managed to finish the game after just maybe 4 tries. It is too easy, player keeps repeating mostly the same basic combinatorical calculations before commencing his turn. Only reason for loosing is the considerable randomness, which can result in prolonged piling up dice-deficit or sustained damage received to vessel, crew or dice.\n\nKeeping available dice for all crewmembers at max is key to victory. This can be hardened or postponed by bad luck (imminent vessel destruction or crewdeaths), which will force you postponing dice reaquisition. Having accidents or large fires in not-so-relevant-modules will worsen your situation futher, while having an accident at medical bay, food-reporoduction or maintaneance bay will give you the chance to invest unspent dicerolls into healing, foodaquisition or shiprepairs after you have solved whatever catastrophe there was (each crew can move somewhere once each turn and try solving/repairing the accident in that module).\nProcedure (simplified):\n1. Move to module\n2. Roll dice and use for repairs\n3. Spend leftover dice on module special function(foodgain/healing/shiprepairs/...) or crewmans special ability\n(4.) Do above steps with the best suited crewmember (if someone needs health, he should put out the fire in medbay, so he can heal himself after the problem is solved). Also consider the order of acting crewmembers.\n\nBasically thats the gist of the game. There are a few more things there, like Challenges and stuff, but not really worth mentioning.\nThe game is really nicely made with a great concept and well executed programming. I never expected using dice mechanisms on such a kind of game would result in such a good game. It probably gave me the best 4 hours of gameplay in months, but thats it. Dont really see much worth in investing more time to play the game, just to repeat over and over what I had been doing for the last 5-7 hours.\nToo bad, the game looked really promising.\n\nFor 6€ (if that is pocket change for you), I would really recommend it - just because it is a rare concept and well made non-average experience. But 15€ is really overpriced for the first game that Im willing to deinstall after just a few hours of easy gameplay. The game is something worth having seen or played once, but doesnt offer much long-term motivation.\n\nI dont want to be misunderstood here:\nPlaying the game is really easy. Determining the optimum and best course and orders of actons to take is easy to moderate. Sometimes you make mistakes because you get lazy thinking it through, but other than those its not that hard to determine what the optimum next steps are each turn. You only loose because of randomness, not because it was too hard to find what to best click next.\nI hoped the game was hard and brutal, requiring a lot from the player to compensate against the odds in dire situations - but its just the opposite... determining the optimum course of actions is way too easy and sadly even trying to think 10 times harder wouldnt give you any other or better course of action. Noone can improve the easily found optimum course of action, no matter what he did.\n\nBest compare the gamepaly to a button game:\nYou may press one of three buttons: 1.button triggers certain death, 2.button has very bad 10% chance of surviving, 3.button obviously has a 25% chance to win.\nDetermining which button to press is easy to moderatly difficult. Pressing the button is ultraeasy. Having any influence of wether button 3 wins or looses the game is nearly impossible.\n\nTharsis is similar to above described game. Very interesting to find out how the game works. Easy to determine how to best play it. Game too easy, outcome mainly only depends on accidental randomness. Would be good if more depended on the player or the game was a bit more complex (probably even harder to balance then).\nAiming to unlock the additional characters keeps you going for a while, which in combination with its uniqueness is probably the motivation why I enjoyed the game so much during the first few hours. Now Ive seen everything and there is not much more to see or enjoy.\nDeinstalling it probably later this evening (maybe Ill play it once or twice more).\n\nEven though it was fun, 15€ is way too much for just a few fun hours.","timestamp_created":1518690632,"timestamp_updated":1518691302,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526814","comment_count":"1","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39982093","author":{"steamid":"76561198038977098","num_games_owned":48,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":45,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1518279182},"language":"english","review":"not very much content, about 20 mins real gameplay for a playthrough\nthere is no story or 'flavor'\nit's a super easy puzzle based on dice","timestamp_created":1518283439,"timestamp_updated":1518283439,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.526814","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}]},"appDetails":{"type":"game","name":"Tharsis","steam_appid":323060,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"A mysterious signal originating from the Tharsis region of Mars set us on a frantic mission.

I like these types of games and have written good reviews on a few Zachtronic games. I really want to write a good review of Infinifactory but I can't. \n\nMy problem with this game is while it is okay to make something have to think to come up with a solution, there is such a thing as making it too hard to figure out. Right from the first training puzzle, the thing I felt was missing that was not the case in other Zachtronic games was the needed components to construct the solution. Shenzhen IO, TIS/100 and SpaceChem always had enough of the basic elements -- motion, a grabber, and a switch -- to complete the problem. With infinifactory, the grabber -- which in this case would be a clamp -- was missing and it was sorely needed on the third training puzzle where I had to weld a vertical two-block stack, then move the union to the transporter. There was simply no way to join two falling objects at different altitudes into a union and then at command move the union to the transporter. I spent a total of 2 and a half hours on that one puzzle before finally giving up and uninstalling.\n\nWhen something becomes too hard to do, it stops being enjoyable. Infinifactory made the learning curve much too steep at the beginning and I truly feel it should have followed a more shallow incline demonstrated in the other games.","timestamp_created":1517332450,"timestamp_updated":1517332450,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.376613","comment_count":"9","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39876671","author":{"steamid":"76561197992522183","num_games_owned":138,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":7,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1517872395},"language":"english","review":"Please let me skip the intro and the tutorial and anything else I'm going to be forced to endure mindlessly...","timestamp_created":1517872455,"timestamp_updated":1517872455,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.331021","comment_count":"1","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}]},"appDetails":{"type":"game","name":"Infinifactory","steam_appid":300570,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"Infinifactory is a sandbox puzzle game by Zachtronics, the creators of SpaceChem and Infiniminer.

Being a bird you can undertake the role of silent observer.

If the art concept doesnt grab your attention there is basically nothing going for limbo, forget about any satisfying gameplay sensation or pleasing of the ears with a sweet soundtrack... It's all simple concept puzzles yet it's quite easy to get confused and to never see the solution even though once you get it, it seems so basic. Again if the art style doesnt fascinate you, limbo is a cold , dark and empty game.\n\n[b][u]-GAMEPLAY:[/u][/b]                           4/10\n\nThis the worst aspect of limbo, the game is slow, unresponsive and reduced to bare bones controls: move, jump, activate. Puzzles are simple and hard at the same time, most of the time you'll get the right solution straight away but unless you get the perfect timing you'll start to search for solutions the game doesnt provide. It's die and retry 101, and there's no two way to go about solving a puzzle.\n\n[b][u]-LEVEL DESIGN:[/u][/b]                        5/10\n \nGo right, sometimes walkback to the left, then go right and jump over a pit. 90% of the game is basic washed up 2D platformer level design mechanics, it start to get good when the games ends sadly, when the gravity comes into play in order to solve the last few puzzles.\n\n[b][u]-VISUAL & ART:[/u][/b]                        7/10\n   \nThis is Limbo's best effort, a dark and coldly portrayed nightmare world. This is the real \"50 shades of grey\", the visual concept brings some good, some bad. This the anti Mario game, no colors , no fun but it's intentional. It's a lonely and painful journey for the game's character but it can turn the same for the player. Yeah it's an artistic choice but this doesn't make for a particularly enjoyable game.\n\n[b][u]-SOUND & MUSIC:[/u][/b]                       5/10\n\nAgain it's a design choice to make the world feel cold and the character lonely but this ends ups being so bare bones that there's barely anything to rate in this domain ! It's a coherent atmosphere but as most of anything in this game it surely can leave you indifferent.\n\n[b][u]-REPLAYABILITY:[/u][/b]                       3/10\n\n3/10 because I doubt you'll ever play through this game more than 3 times.","timestamp_created":1518035543,"timestamp_updated":1518036007,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543568","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39712384","author":{"steamid":"76561198108738502","num_games_owned":17,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":80,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1507254072},"language":"english","review":"It's a special kind of a game...

Just like when INSIDE came out, I was immediately reminded of LIMBO. And any other games that look like this, I always bring up LIMBO and am reminded of LIMBO. The aesthetics of this game was so unique to me when I first saw it, and that was years ago when I didn't even have steam yet. I watched so many different gameplays of this when it first came out because it was just that exciting and intriguing and unique. It definitely opened up a path for a new genre of games and I'm very happy it did.

I remember playing this game back when it came out, and I never really got around to finishing it. However, when I picked it back up again, I was able to vividly recall many of the impactful moments and devilish puzzles this game contains. Its bleak and lonely aesthetic really makes an impression.\n\nThe puzzles in this game definitely have a bit of a difficulty curve. I would also argue that a lot of the puzzle-related elements that are introduced later in the game are a detriment to its immersion. I started to feel a little bit disconnected from the world and found myself playing a run-of-the-mill puzzle game. Another issue is in the controls. The boy doesn't handle nearly as smoothly as he ought to for a game containing puzzles that require some level of precision. Many times did I have to repeat a simple puzzle because the boy grabbed onto something or jumped errantly to his own death.\n\nI can forgive the shortcomings of this game mostly because of its length. If you're focused and are able to figure out puzzles easily, it's a 2-3 hour game. It's really short, moderately sweet, and immensely impactful for a 2D puzzle-platformer.","timestamp_created":1518834289,"timestamp_updated":1518834289,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":3,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.562189","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39969215","author":{"steamid":"76561197994790919","num_games_owned":188,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":645,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1518239574},"language":"english","review":"Meh. It wasn't bad. But it is far, FAR inferior to its successor, Inside, which I can't say enough good things about. I was able to solve all the puzzles without cheating, but many of them were counter-intuitive and required split second timing. There were times when I died like 50 times trying to hit a key at just the right moment and my twitch skills are pretty good.

art, sound and atmosphere, but not much else other then a colossal waste of your time.  \n\nLike many bad plays written by fourth rate playwrights put on in small production houses, this falls flat for the same reasons.  The writing is non-sensical and just bad with no point.  And the game is just writing.  It tries to take a page from other 'remote surrealist' type settings without really capturing any of the magic, wonder, enjoyment, or anything positive.  The games it gets compared to are amazing (Dear Esther, Gone Home, Stanley Parable, etc).  This is not.  The writing spirals and spirals never amounting to anything worth reading except for random disjointed meaningless facts.  If there was an interesting narrative, something worth exploring.  Even something funny.  Hell, then maybe this could have been saved.  But there is just nothing.  This is an exploration of nothing.  It is an exploration of how much can you waste someones time and have them still think there was anything of substance because they don't want to admit there was absolutely nothing in front of them.  \nThis is the type of thing that gives indie art a bad name because a vacuous empty headed moron headed a project and no one had the right mindset to tell them they were terrible.  Then the worst part is people put in good reviews, comparing it to actual games that are art, that have concept, that have life only because they didn't get it, maybe they were just too stoned to have noticed what was in front of them.  Either way, do not waste your time on this garbage.  It is not art.  It is a really, really bad script with some nice visuals.","timestamp_created":1518674001,"timestamp_updated":1518674001,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.464879","comment_count":"1","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39763363","author":{"steamid":"76561198041744013","num_games_owned":158,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":491,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1514085945},"language":"english","review":"Worst game I've ever played--by a significant margin.

You control a team of four agents, each with distinct and unique abilities, collectively battling for control of a simulated, living cyberpunk city. \n \nCustomise your team with the strength to destroy your enemies head-on, or hack into their facilities to manipulate their infrastructure without them ever knowing you were even there. \n \nWill you take down your enemies with brute-force? Covert espionage and infiltration? Or will you use propaganda to influence the citizens of the city and overthrow the controlling powers? \n \nThe world's governments are controlled by mega-corporations, democracy to the highest bidder. Society is structured for the benefit of those in power. The poor exist in the dark squalid underbelly of the city, while the wealthy swim in opulence and luxury on the upper tiers, and the vast middle-class are too comfortable with their lives of convenience to see the world for what it really is. Corporate police patrol the streets, brutally maintaining the status quo, all under the guise of keeping the people safe. The time for change is now, as a mysterious organisation rises from the slums of the city. They'll have to bribe, steal, hack, kill and augment their way through the barriers between them and their ultimate goal...but what are they trying to achieve? To free the masses from the corporate stranglehold, or to take control for themselves? That, is up to you.","storyline":"Satellite Reign takes place in an unnamed fictional city referred as \"The City\" where a corporation named Dracogenics rises after releasing a prototype for Immortality named Resurrection-Tech however Dracogenics turns to Corporate crime and bribes politicians with Immortality for control and influence eventually leading to the privatisation of The City's services and full corporate control over The City's Police Force.

concept.  I recommend if you can get past the following.  Nice successor to the Syndicate series.\n\nThe game designer forgot that many of us already have a job and get to be frustrated there.  I don't want to be frustrated by a game.  It should be fun.  You can't save mid mission.  1 simple bad click will cause a massive firefight which will kill all of your men.  Then you can start all over again, turning off all the security cameras, sneaking all over the place, then make 1 bad click (for example, you accidentally use the move function on a security camera resulting in your men opening fire on it) and your cover is blown 20 minutes into the mission.  Start over and over and over.  That kind of gameplay went out in the 90's.\n\nSome of us just want entertainment, not a job.","timestamp_created":1518964715,"timestamp_updated":1518964715,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527890","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40045658","author":{"steamid":"76561197972464089","num_games_owned":617,"num_reviews":30,"playtime_forever":7013,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1146,"last_played":1519570808},"language":"english","review":"Good game if you like this genre. My biggest gripe is that it is built on a poorly optimized unity engine though i will admit 7/10 unity engine games run like crap and this one is no exception. Other then that I've enjoyed my time with this game. Currently beat it once back 2016 and reinstalled it recently, time to beat it again in ironman mode.\n\nThe game play itself and feel is like an RTS shadowrun, same cyberpunkish theme neon bling and futuristic feel to weapons and skills. Had a story that i honestly don't remeber lol. That was 2 years ago when last played it though, so forgive me for that. Getting old memory isn't like it used to be. \n\nPersonally, i think the game itself not counting unity engine (i really dislike unity engine games). Despite the engine it's a fun & good game. I remeber passing out while playing it a few times, because I liked playing it. Any game I pass out in while playing not related to bordum is a pretty good in my opinion.\n\nSo bottomline if you like RTS games and like smaller squad size (4 here normally 12 if you count hackers drones and 5 hijacked enemies). With cyberpunk theme and rpg elements then give it a go. Pick it up on sale and sink a few 50 or so hrs in. Remeber i passed out a few times, im pretty sure i didn't sink 100 hrs my 1st play through maybe 50-60 actually playing it I could be wrong i don't remeber precisly.","timestamp_created":1518530283,"timestamp_updated":1518787155,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.527027","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40147952","author":{"steamid":"76561197974619567","num_games_owned":629,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":1886,"playtime_last_two_weeks":1644,"last_played":1518850906},"language":"english","review":"This could have been a really good, possibly great game. But there are significant bugs in the UI and game sync.

Especially because I really liked the game at the begining. What stared as a very interesting and promissing game turned out to be a huge waste of time mixed with frustration and anger. \n\nThere are 2 games I bumped into in the recent time and both looked very promising - RUINER and Satellite Reign. RUINER costs 19,99€ and SR 27,99€. So, since I played RUINER and loved it I expected a fun worh almost 50% more than RUINER. Well... not this time I guess, but let's not haste.\n\nWhy to compare these two games? \n1) They are both cyberpunk genre\n2) They both have same isometric graphcs gameplay (Satellite Reign allows small rotation, but it's not enough)\n3) They both promised a great fun in their promo videos/picture with similar gameplay\n4) They both are \"low cost\" and came from relatively unkown publishers (in contrast to giants such as CD Projekt Red,  Bethesda or EA or any other market leading game studios)\n5) Similary complex game control during the play\n6) Although SR is presented as open-world, the city and levels are actully locked - same as in RUINER.\n\nOk, so what is my opinion on Satellite Reign:\n\nPROS:\n+ amazing graphics. Really (with exception of that stupid camera movemet which I had to turn off from the very start), the level of details is simply incredible and although  sometimes the environment looks similar there is always something more. I loved it. It was better than RUINER imho. Although I think they played a little bit more with shaders in RUINER, some effects look better there.\n\nCONS:\n- unable to save during missions. Without checkpoints or anything. You have to simply get through it and succeed or waste another 2 - 4 hours going through the same area (level) again. Time waste per level rises as you progress more in to the game where the levels become bigger and enemies tougher. (I call \"level\" any area where they start to shoot at you on sight).\n\nAfter some frustration I read the forum, hoped to find some quick save feature. None. The only \"excuse\" (presumably from developers/marketing) I found was , that it would be hard to implement... \n\nReally? come on people! At least let the killed enemies be killed and don't respawn more, or divide levels into certain areas based on patrol patterns and once the area is clear, allow people to save game or stop respawning more patrols, or create special designated points inside the level where it would be possible to save progress. I doubt it is hard to save the state of hacked terminals, destroyed/disabled cameras and power supplies, state of doors (closed/open),... - unless, of course you developed a terrible game/engine architecture. Sorry, but \"too hard to implement\" is not an excuse here. Especially for a game which costed me about 50% more than epic RUINER. What about your beta testers? Didn't they complained? Did they actually get through the game? What I saw in forum is that many people are frustrated due to this. \n\n- glitches.  I almost finished a level in industrial section and when I ordered my crew to hide near a fence one of them remained stuck behind it and I could not get him out. After 3 hours of play where I cannot save anything, because it is \"hard to implement\" I had to load the starting position. The more I progressed in the game, the more frequent they become.\n\n- Repetitive music. It seems to me that music is always same, especially when I am inside a level. I did not noticed its' change in different sections (downtown/industrial/...) either. Really ? (50% more than RUINER for this? really?)\n\n- Repetitive level solution. It's hard to be creative with so many enemies around, especially in the begining of the game where your team is weak. You had to find a place where you can destory your enemies one by one to survive (unless you have 12 hours time to waste to keep respawning with your team and do the level over and over again). Once you find this pattern, you tend to stick with it, because it works and it is a small substitute for lack of save (especially when you get the skill to heal your team and research armor wich repairs itself). Only one time I used intruder (number 4) and its' cloak ability to get through the whole level without anybody else, but again - If I should do this all the time (because certainly I could)  why bother to develop other members? Result is that it started to be boring soon. (50% more than RUINER for this? really?)\n\nOverall result is:\nDo not buy this game. It's not worth 27.99. If RUINER is for 19,99 I would rate this to max 14 Euro. Not more. Even that is too much given all the problems the game has. And I'm especially sad because it looked so cool at first sight.\n","timestamp_created":1517789192,"timestamp_updated":1517789192,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.519021","comment_count":"5","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40133249","author":{"steamid":"76561197988186346","num_games_owned":401,"num_reviews":7,"playtime_forever":130,"playtime_last_two_weeks":130,"last_played":1518804885},"language":"english","review":"Ugh I really wanted to like this game.

Unfortunely, the only way I could have fun with this game was by blasting my way in to every objective. Like I said, not a waste of time, lots of fun to have there, but it could have been so much better. It's pretty decent visually. Explosions, laser guns, the environment. Everything looks as it should with a lot of attention to detail. Nothing to complain about this. Story is pretty cool too. The way the story is told is pretty clever.

It consists of two parts, really, overworld \"exploration\" and small combat arenas. In the overworld, you follow a path of unrevealed cards, which are revealed when stepped upon, giving you a random encounter, sometimes with a choice, sometimes just with an effect, and sometimes what you do further has a random chance of succeeding or failing. There's a pretense at it being a draw of a card that you can effect, but it's really just a random dice roll. Sometimes these events will result in a combat arena, where you're locked in with some enemies until they're all dead or, very rarely, a \"puzzle arena\" where your camera is locked at a terrible angle and you do your best to dodge-roll past traps you can hardly see before you're on top of them.\n\nThe issue with the overworld exploration is the hidden cards, really. If you knew which encounters were coming up, and had multiple routes(you very rarely do), you could plan how to approach them based on your food supplies(each card moved takes up 1 food, if you have food, you're healed, if you have none, you're harmed), what gear you have, how risky you want to play it, etc. But as it is, you're just... rolling a die every time you do ANYTHING. Because any given step you take might as well blow you up as help you. So the game never really challenges your planning, just your luck. A second issue is that as you play, your deck of available cards is increased, which means that everything just becomes MORE random. So for instance, on the first level or two, you only fight bandits, so you could go: \"Ah-hah! This item boosts my abilities against bandits! I should prioritize this!\" but soon you've got bandits, lizards, skeletons and rats with more-or-less equal spawn chances so you may as well not even bother to try. You also can't re-equip once you KNOW what you're fighting, so. Yeah.\n\nThe second issue is that the game is extremely enchanted with its presentation. I mean, sure, it's a neat schtick, and sure, the narrator's voice is pretty alright. But by the tenth unskippable card setup scene or repeat of the same voice clip or animation that just drags out a thing I've already seen A HUNDRED TIMES... yeah, my patience starts running out.\n\nI really can't recommend this game, and since the second game looks exactly like the first but with slightly updated graphics? I'd suggest skipping that one as well.","timestamp_created":1518296860,"timestamp_updated":1518296860,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.497942","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39998101","author":{"steamid":"76561198022230454","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":292,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1518342750},"language":"english","review":"Too much to lose, too little to gain.\n\nI really like the premise of the game, but the execution is just too harsh on the player. Skill has very little influence, much less even than in RNG-heavy stuff like Darkest Dungeon (which I did enjoy btw).  I get that a Roguelike is supposed to have a great deal of chance involved, but the cards are, quite literally, stacked way too heavily against you in this game. \n\nAnd even if you do manage to have a bit of luck, it never feels satisfying. Magic items you find only do something in combat, but the majority of events are out-of-combat, where succes is based on drawing the correct card, odds which are usually 50/50 at best, usually worse. Items don't help you there. As a result, you never feel like you're actually getting stronger or getting better at the game. \n\nThe only thing this game does is make you feel helpless because you're running out of food again after 12 cards with no rewards or shops.

It's much more fun, has more content overall, and is significantly more refined overall. This game has too many kinks to recommend it over the 2nd. \n\nWhat is this game?\n\n         Hand of Fate is a Card Game/Beat-Em up hybrid. Most of the game you're dealing with cards as your scenarios and you battle it out in a Batman Style \"Aimless Combat\". What I mean by Aimless combat is that combat is supposed to be fluid enough for you to just let the attacks chain together and not have to individually look at each person to attack. You assume the role of an Adventurer (Or whatever you chose if you have the Wildcard DLC) and you try to wipe out the entire deck of the Dealer, starting at the Jacks and ending with the Kings. \n\n Card Mechanics:\n\n      The Base Mechanics are that you have Health, Food, and Gold. Your health is basic, you need health to survive. Food ticks down every time you move to another part of the map. If you have no food when you move, you start to starve and take damage every next card you move with 0 food. Gold is used for purchasing things or in encounters.\n      There are 2 kinds of buffs and debuffs: Blessings and Curses. Blessings are nothing but good, while Curses can end up changing mechanics or being for the worst. (i.e. Midas Appetite, which causes all your food to turn into gold, and you consume 5 Gold instead of 1 Food.) Curses can be removed at certain shops, while Blessings can only be removed by items, encounters, or curses. \n       Shops will come up on the occasion, with 5 Available Shops: Standard Shops, Travelling Mages, Travelling Jewellers, Travelling Healers, and Travelling Preists. Shops can sell anything and has the most food, Mages have Magical Items and little of anything else, Jewellers only Carry Rings, Healers can remove curses, heal, and add blessings, and Preists can do the same as Healers but for cheaper. All shops will sell food no matter what, so don't worry about starving if you have coin. \n       Encounters can go in certain ways. They can just be passed by most of the time, but sometimes they require either  an action, an offering, or a card pull. Card Pulls you are given 4 Cards in front of you, with 4 different cards available (depending on the difficulty and the encounter): Failure, Success, Huge Failure, and Huge Success. Card Pulls are shuffled in front of you, so you really just need to track which card you want to pull. Sometimes, however, it's shuffled so fast it's almost impossible. \n       You do have gear available to you. You start with an Axe and a Shield and some other gear depending on the difficulty you chose. Your slots are Helmet, Shield, Armor, Gauntlets, Weapon, Rings, Blessings/Curses, and Artifacts. You can only have one of each equipped minus Blessings/Curses and Rings, and their effects stack. \n\nCombat Mechanics:\n        \n      The Combat mechanics are going to be the thing you're fighting most of the time. You use WASD to move, and you have pivital movement (standing still and turning won't turn your body left and right, it moves you forward and turns you). You use M1 to attack and M2 to do a Kick or a Shield Bash, knocking an enemy back slightly and also breaking whatever block they have. Pressing 1 will use a weapon's ability if it has one, and pressing 2 will use an Artefact if you have one. Pressing Q while you have a shield will allow you to reflect certain projectiles and parry certain attacks. Pressing Space will allow you to roll. \n       This game has Arkham Asylum-like beat-em-up combat. You click in the direction of the bad guys and press Q to counter enemies with a green squiggle crown on them. Enemies with Green Squiggles on their head can be parried, and if they're red they can't be parried or blocked. Enemies with Green Spikes on their head is about to shoot a reflectable projectile. It sounds all and good, but all Green Indicators do NOT show up unless you have a shield. No shield, and you have to go off visual cues. \n\n\nWith the basics out of the way, I'm going to talk about most of the issues with the game.\n\nBlessings being next to useless while curses can be crippling or game-ruining. i.e. \"Holy Touch\" makes it so undead that hit you have a chance of recieving damage, while one of the curses called \"Cowardice\" forces you to choose a non-combat encounter choice if available. Both of these have little techincal use, but Blessings are much less common and are outnumbered by Curses (17 Blessings total and 29 total Curses). One of the most problematic curses is Starvation, Consume 2 food instead of 1, or Haunted, which makes it so after every purchase (excluding the purchase to get rid of it) gives you a random curse. \n\nBad Difficulty Curve. Difficulty has 2 or 3 noticible spikes, and the game is trivial most of the time afterwards. I played on Warlord most of my playthrough, and I noticed the main problems was 3 Bosses: The Jack of Plague, the King of Plague, and the Final Boss (which I will reveal under the spoilers section). Rest of it was extremely easy, and I even went for most of the tokens on new cards during this time. \n\nReliance on the Pick a card system. The game relies heavily on the pick one for randomization, and it feels bland and repetitive due to it. Rather than adding more cards or doing a different form, the only times it gets harder is adding more Huge Failures and speeding up the card shuffling. \n\nRe-Using cards. A lot of the token cards are re-used a lot. Blood Auction happens 6 times and are the exact same minus the rewards. Iron Hunger happens 7 times. Shadow Agent happens 8 times. This happens a LOT. \n       \nPoor Telegraphs and Visual Range. Sometimes during combat sections, unblockable attacks are just not going to work out as intented. Sometimes you get hit despite you rolled far enough away, sometimes you don't know it's coming until it's too late. Hellhounds are a big example of this, their unblockable attack seems like a parryable attack until right before you get hit. \n\nClunky Movement. As mentioned before, movement seems more pivotal. You can't stand still and turn a direction, you move while turning that direction. Especially with the trap encounters like Devil's Trap or Trapped Labrynth, it's very easy to get hit or even killed due to this issue. \n\nToo high of a emphasis on combat. This game doesn't do combat well, but it's around 40% of the game. The other 60% being waiting, doing RNG Card pulls, or waiting for dialogue to end. \n\nNo kind of build diversity outside the DLC. You can't really change up a build if you don't have the Wildcard DLC. Wildcard DLC allows you to do different builds, while the base game difficulty cards just give you Easy, Normal, and Hard. \n\nOverall, I think this game is 4/10. It was a good concept and it was GREATLY improved in Hand of Fate 2. I recommend getting Hand of Fate 2 over this by a long shot. However, if you're poor or want to get to know the low-down on the story, get this then. Otherwise, get Hand of Fate 2. \n\n!!! SPOILERS BELOW. THIS PART OF THE REVIEW HAS SPOILERS !!!\n\nThe Final boss fight - The Dealer boss fight is not only boring but also bullshit. The bosses he summons are very easy, but the Dealer's attacks are badly done. They deal too much damage for what they're worth, and how hard the later ones are to dodge. Especially since a RED telegraph on a RED TABLECLOTH is extremely hard to see. On top of that, the Final Phase, the one where he summons the Jack, Queen, and King of Scales, gets drawn out due to the King of Scale's friendly immunity. \n\nThe Dealer's Curses are also really hard to deal with. If you don't get the Travelling Healer or Priest, you're screwed if they're bad. Especially since doing this on Warlord gives you a 40 ENCOUNTER DECK, you will go through much more than you need to. I managed to accrue 10 curses and died to starvation because of starvation curse. It gets very tedious and if you don't get lucky with curses it's over.","timestamp_created":1519372944,"timestamp_updated":1519372944,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.474453","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}]},"appDetails":{"type":"game","name":"Hand of Fate","steam_appid":266510,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"controller_support":"full","dlc":[350460,351430],"detailed_description":"<a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/app/456670\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Add Hand of Fate 2 to your wishlist in order to keep up to date on announcements and release details!</a></a><br><br>&quot;Words fail me at describing just how seamlessly Defiant Development managed to blend the tailored experience aspect of deck building games with the hack-and-slash excitement of action-RPGs.&quot; - The Escapist<br><br>&quot;If you are a fan of either old school adventure books, Gauntlet from its glory days, collectible card games, Rogue or just general fantasy, this game is for you&quot; - Gamestyle 9/10<br><br>&quot;Whether you are a CCG veteran or not, you need to play this game…right now!&quot; - Godisageek 9/10<br><br>&quot;Defiant Development’s newest project feels like playing a customizable card game, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and Batman: Arkham Asylum all at the same time; if that idea doesn’t excite you, then I have no idea what will.&quot; Gaming Union 9/10<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Deckbuilding Comes to Life In hand Of Fate!</h2><br>An infinitely replayable series of quests - earn new cards, build your deck, then try to defeat it! <br><br>Beyond the thirteen gates at the end of the world, the game of life and death is played.

is a single-player, first-person adventure game, focusing on exploration and comedy over puzzle-solving. Each mission has one central objective, but the player is free to explore the game world at their own pace, which is populated with a large number of interactive NPCs, each with their own action or gag. Mini-games, including mini-golf, a Frogger clone, and a version of Duck Hunt in which the player pelts cardboard ducks with slices of bread from a toaster, also feature prominently in the game's storyline.","storyline":"The game is centered around a top-secret espionage agency operating out of an abandoned subway station in late 1950's Japan. The player takes the role of Polyblank, a silent protagonist. The game begins when Polyblank is mailed to the espionage agency in a human-shaped suitcase. He is then given several missions by the head of the organization, all of which begin by ingesting a dose of prescription medicine and which end with the protagonist sitting on a bench in a Zen garden, feeding breadcrumbs to Koi fish. The missions assigned to Polyblank are almost always bizarre and nonsensical, relying heavily on free association and references to older movies and video games. Tasks include degaussing and smuggling pigeons, assassinating cowboys, cross-dressing, killing a pig with a six-string guitar, and photocopying Polyblank's bottom to fool a security scanner.\nThe first mission begins with Polyblank having to infiltrate a Soviet consulate to recover a data cartridge, the second to go to a sushi restaurant to steal a cowboy's artificial kidney. On the way back from the sushi restaurant, Polyblank is intercepted by agents telling him to 'hand over the wetware', but he escapes. The Director then states that Polyblank should take a holiday while they wait for things to die down. When Polyblank gets to Kai Tak Resort for his holiday, he receives a phone call telling him he has to find the syndicate man (The Editor) on site and switch briefcases with him. Polyblank succeeds, but then passes out after drinking a cocktail. Polyblank wakes up in a hotel room at night with a message telling him to come to the rear pool. In the empty rear pool, Polyblank talks to a man who tells him the resort is a simulation, and to get out he must find, kill and cook the mechanical pig. After doing this, and navigating an electric maze, Polyblank finds himself back in the subway station, only to find the Director and his secretary are cardboard cutouts. He then finds an audio message from the Editor telling him if he wants to see them again he should come to his house. Polyblank goes there, and he is told he must beat the Editor in a game of sport for the Director to be freed. Polyblank loses, and so must find prizes for the Editor. Polyblank does this, inflating the Editor's ego, then he pops the Editor with a needle. Polyblank then finds the Director, where to free him he must either press a button. No matter which Polyblank presses, the Director turns into a crocodile and eats Polyblank. The credits take place in the Director's intestines, and then Polyblank is giving special tablets to help him get out.

have been fan of first two games. Unfortunately III & IV didn't reach the heights of them. So I had little doubt about this one too. But 5th installment is great. This isn't masterpiece like first two but this is better than last two games.  \n  \nPros:  \n1. The art style\n2. Voice acting\n3. The story\n4. The humour.\n\nCons:\n1. My game crashes in windows 10 a lot. It hindered my enjoyment slightly. But eventually I could able to finish my game. Crashes were not game breaking but high in numbers.\n\nIf you have older Windows machine, then this is a great game to enjoy. If you can overlook the crash in Win10, then grab this one.  \n\nI give this [b]recommended[/b] stamp.","timestamp_created":1518317687,"timestamp_updated":1518317687,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.000000","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}]},"appDetails":{"type":"game","name":"Broken Sword 5 - the Serpent's Curse","steam_appid":262940,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"controller_support":"full","dlc":[565830],"detailed_description":"Paris in the spring.

An electric griddle works wonders too, if you make a lot of pancakes at your house. The ingredients you’ll need are:\n\n1 ¼ cup milk \n2 eggs \n2 tablespoons vegetable oil \n2 cups all-purpose flour \n2 tablespoons sugar \n3 teaspoons baking powder \n¼ teaspoon salt\n\nThe Batter\nPancakes aren’t complicated, so the batter is everything! For best results, mix that bowl of batter up right before it’s going to hit the griddle.\n\nThe wet ingredients come together first. Beat the milk, eggs and vegetable oil in a mixing bowl with a wire whisk.\n\nThe dry ingredients—flour, baking powder, sugar and salt—are then stirred into the wet mixture. Baking powder is what makes the pancakes fluffy, while the sugar helps the exterior caramelize just enough. And a dash of our friend salt enhances the flavor.\n\nGently mix everything together until it’s combined, but still lumpy. It’ll only take about 10-15 seconds to get to that liquidy-lumpy state. If you over-mix the batter, you’re going to be chowing down on a very tough, rubbery pancake because the gluten molecules start having a party. If you under-mix, you might end up with a mouthful of flour.\n\n\nThe Cooking\nBrush a non-stick griddle or skillet with vegetable oil, clarified butter or cooking spray before heating. You don’t need too much with a nonstick pan. (You may be tempted to use regular butter, but it tends to burn easily. Save the butter for the breakfast table.)\n\nHeat the griddle over medium-high heat. To determine when the griddle is ready for pancake action, run your hand under the faucet and carefully flick just a tiny bit of water onto the surface of the pan. The water droplets will bead up and sizzle when it’s ready.\n\nPour ¼ cup of batter onto the hot griddle and cook 1-2 minutes or until the bubbles on the surface have finished popping and the pancake is dry around the edges.\n\nNow it’s time to flip. Using a spatula, gently turn the pancake over and cook on the other side until golden brown.\n\n\nServe warm\nFluffy Pancakes\nPrint Recipe\n(0) 0 View Full Recipe\nIngredients\nSteps\nHow to Keep Pancakes Hot\nIf you’re cooking for a crowd, turn the oven to 325°F and put your finished pancakes on a baking sheet as they come off the griddle. That way they all stay hot until you are ready to eat.\n\nHow to Store Leftover Pancakes in the Freezer\nStack cooled pancakes between a sheet of waxed paper or parchment. Wrap the stack in foil and freeze. To reheat, preheat the oven to 400°F. Unwrap frozen pancakes and remove from waxed paper. Heat pancakes in a single layer on an ungreased cookie sheet for 5 to 7 minutes or until heated through.\n\nHow to Store Leftover Batter\nStoring leftover batter is one of those things one could technically do, but should one? Nah, one really shouldn’t.\n\nThe baking powder loses its oomph very quickly and the gluten molecules have a field day of chewiness when they are allowed to sit around. Rather than storing leftover batter, we recommend making just the right amount of batter for your breakfast or cooking up the whole batch and storing leftover pancakes in the freezer as directed above.\n\nBack To Top\nTwists on Pancakes\nPancakes are meant to be twisted! There are so many ways you can upgrade your pancakes, from batter mix-ins to mid-griddle additions to final toppings.\n\nBatter mix-ins might include pureed pumpkin with pumpkin pie spice, lemon zest and ricotta cheese or even mashed bananas. Our Gingerbread Pancakes are perfect for the holidays. Buttermilk is a common substitute for milk in pancakes too, as the acidity provides extra volume, browning and flavor. Adding additional (or different) wet ingredients may mean you need to adjust your dry ingredients accordingly, so unless you’re simply shaking a bit of cinnamon into your batter, you’ll want to follow a recipe to make sure your flavored pancakes turn out perfectly.\n\nMid-griddle additions would include those tasty bits that you’ll want to place on your hot cakes before you flip them—things like whole berries, chocolate chips, crunchy granola or little pieces of bacon. Adding these types of things to the individual pancakes rather than the batter helps them stay evenly distributed and keeps them from burning. You can use the same Fluffy Pancake recipe outlined above and easily personalize it with whatever you like without changing the batter.\n\nTopping options are pretty much unlimited when it comes to pancakes, and also don’t require any new recipe. Obviously butter and maple syrup are classic pancake pairings for a reason—there is no substitute for a hefty drizzle of real maple syrup. But it’s also wonderful to think outside the syrup container and try topping your pancakes with jam, caramel, nuts, fruit, whipped cream, sprinkles and more!\n\n8 Easy Twists on Pancakes\n\nGingerbread Pancakes\nGingerbread Pancakes\n\nBlueberry Sour Cream Pancakes\nBl","timestamp_created":1517730984,"timestamp_updated":1517730984,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":9,"votes_funny":32,"weighted_vote_score":"0.478232","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39644461","author":{"steamid":"76561198357374378","num_games_owned":27,"num_reviews":12,"playtime_forever":60,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1517019624},"language":"english","review":"A decent game but not at all worth full price.

a young boy and girl leading parallel lives. The girl has been chosen by her village to be sacrificed to a terrible monster--but she decides to fight back. Meanwhile, a boy on a spaceship is living a solitary life under the care of a motherly computer, but he wants to break free to lead adventures and do good in the world. Adventures ensue.\n\nBroken Age development began when we asked our community if they would help us create a classic-style adventure game without needing to rely on traditional publishers. It turns out they did.\n\nAnd ever since day one, 2 Player Productions has been recording the whole process in an ongoing series of in-depth episodes documenting the creation of a game. Stay tuned for details on how to get your hands on it.","hypes":3,"rating":77.7805264752651,"popularity":4,"aggregated_rating":76.5384615384615,"aggregated_rating_count":14,"total_rating":77.1594940068633,"total_rating_count":68,"rating_count":54,"games":[11270,12517,11233,9727,5601,12597,2993,1906,9061,6707],"tags":[17,18,27,268435458,268435487,268435488,536871208,536871262,536871338,536871506,536871570,536871577,536871627,536871878,536871882,536871931,536871939,536872010,536872064,536872070,536872098,536872140,536872328,536872406,536872435,536872440,536872611,536872647,536872668,536872669,536872810,536872873,536872898,536873247,536873249,536873273,536873425,536873516,536873590,536873973,536874115,536874706,536874743,536874813,536874916,536875042,536875046,536875050,536875057,536875058,536875059,536875062,536875074,536875081,536875084,536875089,536875101,536875107,536875110,536875112,536875113,536875114,536875116,536875130,536875131,536875173,536875182,536875199,536875202,536875208,536875229,536875233,536875239,536875267,536875275,536875276,536875288,536875304,536875315,536875326,536875330,536875334,536875340,536875344,536875362,536875377,536875400,536875419,536875420,536875422,536875453,536875460,536875464,536875480,536875485,536875495,536875498,536875502,536875503,536875504,536875506,536875507,536875510,536875511,536875512,536875521,536875524,536875525,536875531,536875532,536875534,536875536,536875537,536875540,536875542,536875545,536875546,536875554,536875637,536875638,536875650,536875665,536875674,536875675,536875741,536875745,536875804,536875808,536875809,536875819,536875823,536875869,536875914,536875917,536875918,536875951,536876012,536876013,536876015,536876028,536876031,536876069,536876083,536876084,536876098,536876126,536876172,536876178,536876188,536876239,536876241,536876242,536876258,536876287,536876288,536876298,536876304,536876317,536876320,536876339,536876340,536876413,536876414,536876432,536876461,536876473,536876474,536876494,536876516,536876534,536876536,536876546,536876571,536876573,536876574,536876594,536876614,536876617,536876626,536876681,536876722,536876723,536876765,536876868,536876875,536876972,536876984,536877183,536877305,536877384,536877385,536877389,536877392,536877393,536877434,536877517,536877533,536877543,536877566,536877588,536877643,536877804,536877881,536877900,536878032,536878260,536878588,536878592,536878596,536878608,536878611,536879106,536880058,536880331,536880457,536880855,536882430,1073741828],"developers":[85],"publishers":[85,753],"game_engines":[229],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[296,350,426,594,658,665,715,966,970,1019,1027,1098,1152,1158,1186,1228,1416,1494,1523,1528,1699,1735,1756,1757,1898,1961,1986,2335,2337,2361,2513,2604,2678,3061,3203,3794,3831,3901,4004,4130,4134,4138,4145,4146,4147,4150,4162,4169,4172,4177,4189,4195,4198,4200,4201,4202,4204,4218,4219,4261,4270,4287,4290,4296,4317,4321,4327,4355,4363,4364,4376,4392,4403,4414,4418,4422,4428,4432,4450,4465,4488,4507,4508,4510,4541,4548,4552,4568,4573,4583,4586,4590,4591,4592,4594,4595,4598,4599,4600,4609,4612,4613,4619,4620,4622,4624,4625,4628,4630,4633,4634,4642,4725,4726,4738,4753,4762,4763,4829,4833,4892,4896,4897,4907,4911,4957,5002,5005,5006,5039,5100,5101,5103,5116,5119,5157,5171,5172,5186,5214,5260,5266,5276,5327,5329,5330,5346,5375,5376,5386,5392,5405,5408,5427,5428,5501,5502,5520,5549,5561,5562,5582,5604,5622,5624,5634,5659,5661,5662,5682,5702,5705,5714,5769,5810,5811,5853,5956,5963,6060,6072,6271,6393,6472,6473,6477,6480,6481,6522,6605,6621,6631,6654,6676,6731,6892,6969,6988,7120,7348,7676,7680,7684,7696,7699,8194,9146,9419,9545,9943,11518],"themes":[17,18,27],"genres":[2,31,32],"first_release_date":1390867200000,"pulse_count":4,"platforms":[34,45,6,39,14,46,48,72,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1430265600000,"region":1,"human":"2015-Apr-29","y":2015,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1430179200000,"region":2,"human":"2015-Apr-28","y":2015,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1390867200000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Jan-28","y":2014,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1390867200000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Jan-28","y":2014,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":72,"date":1401408000000,"region":8,"human":"2014-May-30","y":2014,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1390867200000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Jan-28","y":2014,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1402531200000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Jun-12","y":2014,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1430179200000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Apr-28","y":2015,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1430179200000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Apr-28","y":2015,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1430179200000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Apr-28","y":2015,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Double

is a point-and-click adventure game in which players assume the role of two teenagers trying to stop creatures from destroying their world. Players explore fantastical environments, interact with different characters, and search for items to progress the story. A handful of sequences depict various acts of violence: a character firing lasers at a giant monster; characters engaging in hand-to-hand combat; a ship hit with exploding projectiles. One sequence depicts a large chum bucket filled with red blood-like liquid. During the course of the game, a character coerces a tree creature into vomiting tree sap into a bucket. The word “damn” is heard in the dialogue.","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/232790"},{"category":1,"url":"http://brokenagegame.com/"}],"external":{"steam":"232790"}},"humbleBundle":{"bundle":"february_2016_monthly","custom_download_page_box_html":"","downloads":[{"android_app_only":false,"download_identifier":"","download_struct":[{"file_size":2159926882,"human_size":"2 GB","md5":"d442d6491876db63b0cacfe7e746d184","name":"Download","sha1":"a0d56af70bfeb042aa198400b8e73a643d9d7171","small":0,"timestamp":1497465374,"uploaded_at":"2017-06-14T18:24:47.452130","url":{"bittorrent":"https://dl.humble.com/torrents/doublefine/BrokenAge_linux.tar.gz.torrent?gamekey=wdEecpsKc2U5yXzv&ttl=1519664844&t=3fbee1dd1cca80fafbf9fc96a82f4931","web":"https://dl.humble.com/doublefine/BrokenAge_linux.tar.gz?gamekey=wdEecpsKc2U5yXzv&ttl=1519664844&t=92675266347f39076142f08ba4879404"}}],"download_version_number":null,"machine_name":"brokenage_linux","options_dict":{},"platform":"linux"},{"android_app_only":false,"download_identifier":"","download_struct":[{"file_size":2151612988,"human_size":"2 GB","md5":"cf4762dab29bd9d6de1804ff753a00b2","name":"Download","sha1":"829e8e2cf7ad7badfe21742b8921701655e5cc5b","small":0,"timestamp":1497464262,"uploaded_at":"2017-06-14T18:06:30.774180","url":{"bittorrent":"https://dl.humble.com/torrents/doublefine/BrokenAge_osx.zip.torrent?gamekey=wdEecpsKc2U5yXzv&ttl=1519664844&t=ada633177e6b01e3b57487ea6d72f8f2","web":"https://dl.humble.com/doublefine/BrokenAge_osx.zip?gamekey=wdEecpsKc2U5yXzv&ttl=1519664844&t=e3d50d235b0f9ab3112349b6aa7b76fd"}}],"download_version_number":null,"machine_name":"brokenage_mac","options_dict":{},"platform":"mac"},{"android_app_only":false,"download_identifier":"","download_struct":[{"file_size":2152195423,"human_size":"2 GB","md5":"7672ca3122d31977521d622a4cc877b8","name":"Download","sha1":"572a50c97167e794492c434038580c5bb40008b5","small":0,"timestamp":1497462113,"uploaded_at":"2017-06-14T17:29:47.597330","url":{"bittorrent":"https://dl.humble.com/torrents/doublefine/BrokenAge_win.zip.torrent?gamekey=wdEecpsKc2U5yXzv&ttl=1519664844&t=7cd1088f3bb5beb65067539323c20717","web":"https://dl.humble.com/doublefine/BrokenAge_win.zip?gamekey=wdEecpsKc2U5yXzv&ttl=1519664844&t=c34744e9b72306673c23cb56ba02ad4c"}}],"download_version_number":null,"machine_name":"brokenage_windows","options_dict":{},"platform":"windows"}],"human_name":"Broken Age","icon":"https://humblebundle.imgix.net/misc/files/hashed/2f2ab67de9ee75e066c1e3e556c979a8caaf4660.png?auto=format&s=09b4fb2c3910e256ce2a59c18d76e5af","library_family_name":null,"machine_name":"brokenage","payee":{"human_name":"Double Fine Productions","machine_name":"doublefine"},"url":"http://www.brokenagegame.com/"},"steam":{"reviews":{"success":1,"query_summary":{"num_reviews":11,"review_score":8,"review_score_desc":"Very Positive","total_positive":2078,"total_negative":498,"total_reviews":2576},"reviews":[{"recommendationid":"39069208","author":{"steamid":"76561197986827122","num_games_owned":87,"num_reviews":49,"playtime_forever":120,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1513467085},"language":"english","review":"The voice acting and art design was fantastic.

This game has no deaths, and limited inventory items (which means fewer useless objects being hauled around). Where the game-play diverts from a traditional point and click, is there are no ' True timing based ' problems, meaning everything is sequential, so if a character watching something ' just gets back' that means you've missed a step or you're not doing the correct solution. Talking to characters, is also essential in solving problems, and the way the game is there are certain characters you need to talk with, talk to other characters, and THEN return to the character to open new dialouge. Most puzzles cannot be 'brute forced' or even 'logically/systematically' solved, so you may be wasting time taking excessive notes during gameplay. although to be fair during the 2nd act there are more logic/mind puzzles which are satisfying to finally solve. There are also a particular puzzle that is really Rigid, its a \"timing\" based sequence, but its very unforgiving, and its not clear what you are exactly trying to do, also there are elements that arent obvious to make it even more convelouted. you just have to repetatively perform the same task over and over until you see what exactly you're missing, then once you 'see it' you will have to suffer more frustration as you realize the timing aspect doesn't set you up to complete the sequence, with out some back and forth...\n\nthe length of the game feels about right for a $8 game. but $20 is outrageous, Thimbleweed park is a much better buy at that pricepoint.\n\n\nGRAPHICS/DESIGN: there is no real nostalgia factor here for the point-and-click genre, instead you have a 'storybook' motiff through out, that has animation like it came out of flash, now its much more sophisticated and polished, and it looks great. The characters are Cute, HOWEVER they did go cheap in that there are 2 missing Characters in the Game! they are referenced multiple times, you're even told they are in a room with other characters, but you never see them, even at the END of the game where everyone is reunited these two characters are not present, it totally breaks continuity and just is such a huge oversight.\n\n\n\n SOUND: The music is SIMPLY AMAZING, and the VOICE ACTING IS SPOT on!, The best character (NPC) in the game BY FAR is Curtis the Wood-Cutter, he deserves his own point-and-click adventure title. i am Dead serious, he is so charismatic and likable, and absolutely hilarious, its a shame that he doesn't have a bigger role in the game, but then sometimes less is more.\n\n\n\nSTORY: a lot of people bag on the story... i actually thought that the story was REALLY creative! its unlike any other point-and-click title out there, its Fun, engaging, but slow to start. I do have to say the ENDING was REALLY Poorly handled, it felt like a rush job / hurry up and wrap it up, type thing, very anticlimatic, there should have been a 3rd act as everyone else said. Also the Glaring issue of 2 characters who are referenced through-out the game never showing up (from the Cloud city) - oh well i guess they just DIED, they don't even have names, just birdgirl one and two.\n\n\nOVERALL: i would definitely put this game in the top 5 'New Point and click adventure games' one or two spots below thimbleweed park. i had fun playing it, and it was VERY SOLID despite its shortcomings.","timestamp_created":1515406580,"timestamp_updated":1515406580,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.520505","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"38606585","author":{"steamid":"76561198263647681","num_games_owned":26,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":429,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1514865773},"language":"english","review":"Wow. WOW. Where to start. Let me just say, this game is absolutely AMAZING. I don't usually write reviews, but I simply had to for this gem of a game.\n\n1. The graphics\nThe backgrounds are beautifully drawn, even when I was first in Shay's spaceship I was mesmerized by the amount of detail in the design of the ship. I could even see the brush strokes which gave a really cool texture to the walls. They have a childlike feel to them, and each place is so unique and imaginatively structured. There never seemed to be an end to the creativity!\n\n2. Character design\nEach character in this game has such a unique personality and design. I absolutely love the talking animations, even though they get repetitive (should they not? I mean, characters talk a lot) I don't mind at all. Once in a while when Shay or Vella picks a certain dialogue option you get a different talk animation than the usual, and I think that's so cool!\n\n3. The puzzles\nI see a lot of negative reviews solely based on the puzzles, and I do have to say, they are very difficult. Coming from a person who doesn't play a lot of puzzle/brain type games, I did have to use a guide to figure them out. However, that doesn't mean they're impossible. I'm 100% positive a large amount of people could figure them out with no help. I didn't mind using a guide, it didn't give or take away from the game experience for me.\n\n4. Soundtrack\nThere's not much I can describe about the music, as everyone has their own opinion of what music they like. However, in my opinion the soundtrack was beautifully composed, with very lovely themes and dramatic tones when needed. It made the scenery and graphics so much more pleasant!\n\n5. Voice acting\nThere is way more than you originally expect to this game. Twists, turns, and a lovely blending of the two story paths that perfectly ties together the ending. I'm not a very thourough game purchaser, and I tend to just skim over descriptions of everything I buy. (Not a very good choice, I know, but its given me some fun surprises in the past.) Fortunately not reading this game's description while I bought it on a whim when I had a gift card and found it on sale, left me the fun part of figuring out the voice actors of each character. \n\nShay immediately became my favorite, because Elijah Wood, come on! I enjoyed his acting in Over the Garden Wall, and I was so excited when I learned he is expanding his repitoire. I have a bad habit of skipping dialogue in games like these, because I have a short attention span, and it just gets boring, y'know? But with this game, I sat through every single dialogue option (except for the repeats, of course) and [i] listened. [/i] It's not much to put in my review, but for me personally, that was a huge plus.\n\n\nAll in all, I hope I've convinced whoever's reading this review to purchase this game and give it a try. You'll come away in a good mood, eagerly awaiting the next masterpiece of Double Fine Productions in the coming years.","timestamp_created":1514089847,"timestamp_updated":1515296116,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.521955","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39244302","author":{"steamid":"76561198256245874","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":63,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1515292215},"language":"english","review":"If you're really into click and point adventures that move at an extremely slow pace, this game is for you.

was hoping for another game like TitanSouls, and while this is similar in layout its execution is very different.\n\n-I like hand drawn art, but theres poor linework everywhere and the general lack of detail in the environments makes trudging slowly through them very tiresome.\n-The character controls are very simple, very clunky and really boring.\n-The bosses are interesting designs, but the boss fights are horrible because of how slow and clunky your character is, it makes certain boss attacks feel really cheap because its almost impossible to avoid them without lucking out on their random placement (particularly the lightning giant to the north)\n\nIf this game was designed to be a little bit faster paced and a more fluid character control, then it would probably be pretty neat.\nBut that's not how it is, can't reccomend buying this one.","timestamp_created":1518513654,"timestamp_updated":1518513654,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.577465","comment_count":"1","steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39851947","author":{"steamid":"76561198111267534","num_games_owned":12,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":81,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1517774061},"language":"english","review":"Really mediocre game. I noticed this game for it's cool styling and design when it came out a few years ago. I'd been waiting for a while to buy, now I regret buying it. I haven't played that much, and I doubt I'll play a lot more. Besides the comic-book styling there's little to recommend it. You wander around, usually there's some kind of avoidance trick: vines, wind, sea monsters. Then there's checkpoints, places to get power ups, and bosses. That's about it. For an adventure exploration game there's very little sense of discovery. The fights are repetitive, the puzzles are annoying. I found myself accidentally throwing away my power-ups all the time, which are the only way to beat the big bosses. \nSpeaking of the big bosses, the scale is kinda cool, the bosses are HUGE compared to your character, but when you fight them you become a tiny blob on the screen. Caveat, I'm couch playing this game, so that probably contributes to the small-blobiness of the character. \nI guess one more positive is the voice acting. I do like the old Norse, or fake Norse that's read at various intervals. \nI'd give this a 2 out of 5 stars.","timestamp_created":1517775264,"timestamp_updated":1517775264,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.588460","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39513201","author":{"steamid":"76561198175929906","num_games_owned":29,"num_reviews":4,"playtime_forever":183,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1518050008},"language":"english","review":"It is a good game\nThe atmosphere is great and I like this cartoony style\nGG","timestamp_created":1516548335,"timestamp_updated":1516548335,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":2,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.543568","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"40107650","author":{"steamid":"76561198097792984","num_games_owned":21,"num_reviews":6,"playtime_forever":566,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1487197643},"language":"english","review":"[b]Jotun[/b] is an action-exploration game, by [b]Thunder Lotus Games[/b], set in Norse mythology.\n\nThe game's setting and hand-drawn art style was what captured my attention.

you like any of the following, you'll enjoy this game: Labyrinth, Alice in Wonderland, Mirrormask, Neverending Story, etc etc.\n\nFran, a young girl, ends up in a twisted mental hospital, following the homicide of her parents. Who killed them and why? Fran is given a mysterious drug that lets her switch between realities and travel to new worlds parallel to ours. She sees weird monsters and imaginary friends. What is real? Is someone trying to kill her?\n\nThe game play is about 8 hours with 5 chapters, and very similar to The Silent Age, another point and click game that lets you switch between realities. The puzzles are not overly difficult but some of them are obtuse, requiring you to randomly click on things until something works.\n\nThere are some stupidly easy platform jumping and maze games, there's no fail state and some you can just skip over.\n\nThere's some very disturbing imagery (a la Hellraiser) and surrealistic horror. Lots of dead children, gore, and bad things happening to people. Not recommended for young children, but there's no sex or cursing. Fran remains optimistic even though really terrible things are happening to her. It falls into the realm of horror fantasy, and it's not all horrible. The middle bit is fantasy, and there's some murder mystery thrown in for good measure.\n\nIt was really fun to play, the art is delightful, and it'll leave you thinking. Highly recommended!","timestamp_created":1517084613,"timestamp_updated":1517084613,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.616725","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"39630794","author":{"steamid":"76561198336183474","num_games_owned":86,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"last_played":1517146926},"language":"english","review":"I freaking love this girl, she is so cool. I don't care about my life very much, but I was worried sick about this girl. Despite knowing how this game works and ways to solve puzzles, I looked into a walk-through few times, just to be sure that Fran absolutely definitely won't die (it actually ruined some moments of the game for me, don't do that).\nI was a little disappointed in the end, because, well, I knew that nothing can be perfect in Fran's life anymore, but I still hoped it freaking will, because she is so cool. She was the one in the game, who calmed me down, with her childish and innocent attitude. You know, I see a monster and my instincts are screaming: \"we're DONE, Fran will die because of me\", and then this little girl just says something like: \"hello mr. Monster, how is your day?\" She is the only reason I finished this game.

The pixel art is kind of muddy.  There are a lot of cheap deaths.  Base movespeed is probably too slow for how fast enemy projectiles are, and you should probably be able to see further around you.\n\nFor comparison, let's talk about what enter the gungeon does that nuclear throne doesn't.   EtG goes on sale frequently for $7.50.  There are many more guns and they're a lot more distinct from each other.  There's a massive amount of items.  There are more bosses and enemies, which are mostly designed well.  The gameplay is more fair and intuitive.  There's a more compelling progression arc with more content to it.  Graphically, it's clean.  It supports widescreen and will run at 1440p and 144hz if you have the monitor for it.
